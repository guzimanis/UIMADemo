Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or&#13;&#10;five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“How so? How can it affect them?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome! You&#13;&#10;must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Is that his design in settling here?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he&#13;&#10;_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as&#13;&#10;soon as he comes.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send&#13;&#10;them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are&#13;&#10;as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the&#13;&#10;party.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but&#13;&#10;I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five&#13;&#10;grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into&#13;&#10;the neighbourhood.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would&#13;&#10;be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to&#13;&#10;go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no&#13;&#10;newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to&#13;&#10;visit him if you do not.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very&#13;&#10;glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my&#13;&#10;hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though&#13;&#10;I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the&#13;&#10;others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so&#13;&#10;good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he; “they are&#13;&#10;all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of&#13;&#10;quickness than her sisters.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Mr. Bennet, how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way? You&#13;&#10;take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They&#13;&#10;are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration&#13;&#10;these last twenty years at least.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four&#13;&#10;thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not&#13;&#10;visit them.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them&#13;&#10;all.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,&#13;&#10;reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had&#13;&#10;been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind&#13;&#10;was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,&#13;&#10;little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented,&#13;&#10;she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her&#13;&#10;daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 2&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He&#13;&#10;had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring&#13;&#10;his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was&#13;&#10;paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following&#13;&#10;manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he&#13;&#10;suddenly addressed her with:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother&#13;&#10;resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the&#13;&#10;assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces&#13;&#10;of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion&#13;&#10;of her.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do&#13;&#10;not depend on her serving you.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain&#13;&#10;herself, began scolding one of her daughters.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven’s sake! Have a little&#13;&#10;compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times&#13;&#10;them ill.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully. “When is&#13;&#10;your next ball to be, Lizzy?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“To-morrow fortnight.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back&#13;&#10;till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him,&#13;&#10;for she will not know him herself.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce&#13;&#10;Mr. Bingley to _her_.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him&#13;&#10;myself; how can you be so teasing?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly&#13;&#10;very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a&#13;&#10;fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else will; and after all,&#13;&#10;Mrs. Long and her neices must stand their chance; and, therefore, as&#13;&#10;she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will&#13;&#10;take it on myself.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,&#13;&#10;nonsense!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do&#13;&#10;you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on&#13;&#10;them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,&#13;&#10;Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read&#13;&#10;great books and make extracts.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.&#13;&#10;Bingley.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that before? If&#13;&#10;I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called&#13;&#10;on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we&#13;&#10;cannot escape the acquaintance now.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.&#13;&#10;Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy&#13;&#10;was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the&#13;&#10;while.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should&#13;&#10;persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to&#13;&#10;neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a&#13;&#10;good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a&#13;&#10;word about it till now.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and,&#13;&#10;as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“What an excellent father you have, girls!” said she, when the door was&#13;&#10;shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;&#13;&#10;or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so&#13;&#10;pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but&#13;&#10;for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_&#13;&#10;the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next&#13;&#10;ball.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the&#13;&#10;youngest, I’m the tallest.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would&#13;&#10;return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to&#13;&#10;dinner.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 3&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five&#13;&#10;daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her&#13;&#10;husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him&#13;&#10;in various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and&#13;&#10;distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at&#13;&#10;last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,&#13;&#10;Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been&#13;&#10;delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely&#13;&#10;agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly&#13;&#10;with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of&#13;&#10;dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively&#13;&#10;hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,”&#13;&#10; said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well&#13;&#10;married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about&#13;&#10;ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being&#13;&#10;admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had&#13;&#10;heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more&#13;&#10;fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper&#13;&#10;window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already&#13;&#10;had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her&#13;&#10;housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley&#13;&#10;was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable&#13;&#10;to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite&#13;&#10;disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town&#13;&#10;so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that&#13;&#10;he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never&#13;&#10;settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears&#13;&#10;a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get&#13;&#10;a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley&#13;&#10;was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.&#13;&#10;The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the&#13;&#10;day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only&#13;&#10;six with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin. And when&#13;&#10;the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five&#13;&#10;altogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and&#13;&#10;another young man.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant&#13;&#10;countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,&#13;&#10;with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely&#13;&#10;looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention&#13;&#10;of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and&#13;&#10;the report which was in general circulation within five minutes&#13;&#10;after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen&#13;&#10;pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he&#13;&#10;was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great&#13;&#10;admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust&#13;&#10;which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be&#13;&#10;proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all&#13;&#10;his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most&#13;&#10;forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared&#13;&#10;with his friend.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal&#13;&#10;people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,&#13;&#10;was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving&#13;&#10;one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for&#13;&#10;themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced&#13;&#10;only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being&#13;&#10;introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in&#13;&#10;walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.&#13;&#10;His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man&#13;&#10;in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.&#13;&#10;Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of&#13;&#10;his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his&#13;&#10;having slighted one of her daughters.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit&#13;&#10;down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been&#13;&#10;standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.&#13;&#10;Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend&#13;&#10;to join it.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you&#13;&#10;standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better&#13;&#10;dance.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am&#13;&#10;particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this&#13;&#10;it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not&#13;&#10;another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to&#13;&#10;stand up with.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Mr. Bingley, “for a&#13;&#10;kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in&#13;&#10;my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see&#13;&#10;uncommonly pretty.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr.&#13;&#10;Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one&#13;&#10;of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I&#13;&#10;dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Which do you mean?” and turning round he looked for a moment at&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:&#13;&#10;“She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I am in no&#13;&#10;humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted&#13;&#10;by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her&#13;&#10;smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth&#13;&#10;remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,&#13;&#10;however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,&#13;&#10;playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.&#13;&#10;Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield&#13;&#10;party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been&#13;&#10;distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as&#13;&#10;her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane’s&#13;&#10;pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most&#13;&#10;accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been&#13;&#10;fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they&#13;&#10;had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good&#13;&#10;spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they&#13;&#10;were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With&#13;&#10;a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a&#13;&#10;good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised&#13;&#10;such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife’s views on&#13;&#10;the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a&#13;&#10;different story to hear.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most&#13;&#10;delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.&#13;&#10;Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well&#13;&#10;she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with&#13;&#10;her twice! Only think of _that_, my dear; he actually danced with her&#13;&#10;twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second&#13;&#10;time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand&#13;&#10;up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody&#13;&#10;can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going&#13;&#10;down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and&#13;&#10;asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King,&#13;&#10;and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again,&#13;&#10;and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_--”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,&#13;&#10;“he would not have danced half so much! For God’s sake, say no more of&#13;&#10;his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively&#13;&#10;handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw&#13;&#10;anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.&#13;&#10;Hurst’s gown--”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any&#13;&#10;description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch&#13;&#10;of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some&#13;&#10;exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not&#13;&#10;suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at&#13;&#10;all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring&#13;&#10;him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very&#13;&#10;great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my&#13;&#10;dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 4&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in&#13;&#10;her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very&#13;&#10;much she admired him.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,&#13;&#10;good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much&#13;&#10;ease, with such perfect good breeding!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought&#13;&#10;likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I&#13;&#10;did not expect such a compliment.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between&#13;&#10;us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What&#13;&#10;could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help&#13;&#10;seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman&#13;&#10;in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is&#13;&#10;very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a&#13;&#10;stupider person.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Dear Lizzy!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.&#13;&#10;You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable&#13;&#10;in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your&#13;&#10;life.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak&#13;&#10;what I think.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_&#13;&#10;good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of&#13;&#10;others! Affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with it&#13;&#10;everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the&#13;&#10;good of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing&#13;&#10;of the bad--belongs to you alone. And so you like this man’s sisters,&#13;&#10;too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Certainly not--at first. But they are very pleasing women when you&#13;&#10;converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep&#13;&#10;his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming&#13;&#10;neighbour in her.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at&#13;&#10;the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more&#13;&#10;quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister,&#13;&#10;and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she&#13;&#10;was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine&#13;&#10;ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the&#13;&#10;power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and&#13;&#10;conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the&#13;&#10;first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand&#13;&#10;pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of&#13;&#10;associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect&#13;&#10;entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of&#13;&#10;a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply&#13;&#10;impressed on their memories than that their brother’s fortune and their&#13;&#10;own had been acquired by trade.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred&#13;&#10;thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an&#13;&#10;estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and&#13;&#10;sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a&#13;&#10;good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those&#13;&#10;who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the&#13;&#10;remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to&#13;&#10;purchase.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,&#13;&#10;though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no&#13;&#10;means unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had&#13;&#10;married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider&#13;&#10;his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of&#13;&#10;age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation&#13;&#10;to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for&#13;&#10;half-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principal&#13;&#10;rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it&#13;&#10;immediately.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of&#13;&#10;great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the&#13;&#10;easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition&#13;&#10;could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he&#13;&#10;never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley&#13;&#10;had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion.&#13;&#10;In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means&#13;&#10;deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,&#13;&#10;reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not&#13;&#10;inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley&#13;&#10;was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually&#13;&#10;giving offense.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently&#13;&#10;characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or&#13;&#10;prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive&#13;&#10;to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt&#13;&#10;acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not&#13;&#10;conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a&#13;&#10;collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for&#13;&#10;none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received&#13;&#10;either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,&#13;&#10;but she smiled too much.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired&#13;&#10;her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one&#13;&#10;whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore&#13;&#10;established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such&#13;&#10;commendation to think of her as he chose.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 5&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets&#13;&#10;were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade&#13;&#10;in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the&#13;&#10;honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.&#13;&#10;The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a&#13;&#10;disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town;&#13;&#10;and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house&#13;&#10;about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge,&#13;&#10;where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and,&#13;&#10;unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all&#13;&#10;the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him&#13;&#10;supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By&#13;&#10;nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.&#13;&#10;James’s had made him courteous.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a&#13;&#10;valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest&#13;&#10;of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was&#13;&#10;Elizabeth’s intimate friend.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over&#13;&#10;a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly&#13;&#10;brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet with civil&#13;&#10;self-command to Miss Lucas. “_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first choice.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be&#13;&#10;sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he&#13;&#10;_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something&#13;&#10;about Mr. Robinson.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not&#13;&#10;I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he liked our Meryton&#13;&#10;assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many&#13;&#10;pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his&#13;&#10;answering immediately to the last question: ‘Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,&#13;&#10;beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.’”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed--that does seem as&#13;&#10;if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,” said&#13;&#10;Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,&#13;&#10;is he?--poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I beg you would not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his&#13;&#10;ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite&#13;&#10;a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he&#13;&#10;sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Are you quite sure, ma’am?--is not there a little mistake?” said Jane.&#13;&#10;“I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he&#13;&#10;could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at&#13;&#10;being spoke to.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much,&#13;&#10;unless among his intimate acquaintances. With _them_ he is remarkably&#13;&#10;agreeable.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very&#13;&#10;agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it&#13;&#10;was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had&#13;&#10;heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to&#13;&#10;the ball in a hack chaise.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I&#13;&#10;wish he had danced with Eliza.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with _him_,&#13;&#10;if I were you.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as pride&#13;&#10;often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so&#13;&#10;very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,&#13;&#10;should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_&#13;&#10;to be proud.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive&#13;&#10;_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her&#13;&#10;reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have&#13;&#10;ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human&#13;&#10;nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us&#13;&#10;who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some&#13;&#10;quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different&#13;&#10;things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may&#13;&#10;be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of&#13;&#10;ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with&#13;&#10;his sisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of&#13;&#10;foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs.&#13;&#10;Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle&#13;&#10;directly.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she&#13;&#10;would, and the argument ended only with the visit.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 6&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit&#13;&#10;was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners grew on&#13;&#10;the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was&#13;&#10;found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,&#13;&#10;a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards&#13;&#10;the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest&#13;&#10;pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment&#13;&#10;of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;&#13;&#10;though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in&#13;&#10;all probability from the influence of their brother’s admiration. It&#13;&#10;was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her and&#13;&#10;to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference&#13;&#10;which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a&#13;&#10;way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it&#13;&#10;was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane&#13;&#10;united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a&#13;&#10;uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions&#13;&#10;of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It may perhaps be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose&#13;&#10;on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be&#13;&#10;so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill&#13;&#10;from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and&#13;&#10;it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in&#13;&#10;the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every&#13;&#10;attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all&#13;&#10;_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are&#13;&#10;very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without&#13;&#10;encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show _more_&#13;&#10;affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he&#13;&#10;may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can&#13;&#10;perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to&#13;&#10;discover it too.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal&#13;&#10;it, he must find it out.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane&#13;&#10;meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they&#13;&#10;always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that&#13;&#10;every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should&#13;&#10;therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his&#13;&#10;attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for&#13;&#10;falling in love as much as she chooses.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in&#13;&#10;question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined&#13;&#10;to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But&#13;&#10;these are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet,&#13;&#10;she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its&#13;&#10;reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four&#13;&#10;dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,&#13;&#10;and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite&#13;&#10;enough to make her understand his character.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might&#13;&#10;only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must&#13;&#10;remember that four evenings have also been spent together--and four&#13;&#10;evenings may do a great deal.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they&#13;&#10;both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other&#13;&#10;leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and&#13;&#10;if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a&#13;&#10;chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a&#13;&#10;twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If&#13;&#10;the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or&#13;&#10;ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the&#13;&#10;least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to&#13;&#10;have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as&#13;&#10;possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your&#13;&#10;life.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not&#13;&#10;sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attentions to her sister, Elizabeth&#13;&#10;was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some&#13;&#10;interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely&#13;&#10;allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the&#13;&#10;ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no&#13;&#10;sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly&#13;&#10;had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered&#13;&#10;uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To&#13;&#10;this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had&#13;&#10;detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry&#13;&#10;in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and&#13;&#10;pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those&#13;&#10;of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of&#13;&#10;this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made&#13;&#10;himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough&#13;&#10;to dance with.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing&#13;&#10;with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so&#13;&#10;drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party were&#13;&#10;assembled.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my&#13;&#10;conversation with Colonel Forster?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see&#13;&#10;what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by&#13;&#10;being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have&#13;&#10;any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such&#13;&#10;a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she&#13;&#10;turned to him and said:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly&#13;&#10;well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at&#13;&#10;Meryton?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady&#13;&#10;energetic.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You are severe on us.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am going&#13;&#10;to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me&#13;&#10;to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken&#13;&#10;a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would&#13;&#10;really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of&#13;&#10;hearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas’s persevering, however,&#13;&#10;she added, “Very well, if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing&#13;&#10;at Mr. Darcy, “There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of&#13;&#10;course familiar with: ‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge’; and I&#13;&#10;shall keep mine to swell my song.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song&#13;&#10;or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that&#13;&#10;she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her&#13;&#10;sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in&#13;&#10;the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always&#13;&#10;impatient for display.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her&#13;&#10;application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited&#13;&#10;manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she&#13;&#10;had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with&#13;&#10;much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the&#13;&#10;end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by&#13;&#10;Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who,&#13;&#10;with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in&#13;&#10;dancing at one end of the room.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of&#13;&#10;passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too&#13;&#10;much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was&#13;&#10;his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There&#13;&#10;is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first&#13;&#10;refinements of polished society.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst&#13;&#10;the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he&#13;&#10;continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt&#13;&#10;not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do&#13;&#10;you often dance at St. James’s?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Never, sir.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You have a house in town, I conclude?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Darcy bowed.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself--for I am fond&#13;&#10;of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of&#13;&#10;London would agree with Lady Lucas.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed&#13;&#10;to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was&#13;&#10;struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to&#13;&#10;her:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow&#13;&#10;me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You&#13;&#10;cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.”&#13;&#10; And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though&#13;&#10;extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly&#13;&#10;drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you&#13;&#10;not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of&#13;&#10;her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at&#13;&#10;all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny&#13;&#10;me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the&#13;&#10;amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us&#13;&#10;for one half-hour.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza,&#13;&#10;we cannot wonder at his complaisance--for who would object to such a&#13;&#10;partner?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not&#13;&#10;injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some&#13;&#10;complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I should imagine not.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings&#13;&#10;in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.&#13;&#10;I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise--the&#13;&#10;nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would&#13;&#10;I give to hear your strictures on them!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more&#13;&#10;agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure&#13;&#10;which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he&#13;&#10;would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.&#13;&#10;Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all astonishment.&#13;&#10;How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray, when am I to wish you&#13;&#10;joy?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady’s&#13;&#10;imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love&#13;&#10;to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is&#13;&#10;absolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed;&#13;&#10;and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to&#13;&#10;entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her&#13;&#10;that all was safe, her wit flowed long.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 7&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two&#13;&#10;thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,&#13;&#10;in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s&#13;&#10;fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply&#13;&#10;the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and&#13;&#10;had left her four thousand pounds.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to&#13;&#10;their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in&#13;&#10;London in a respectable line of trade.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most&#13;&#10;convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted&#13;&#10;thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and&#13;&#10;to a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,&#13;&#10;Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;&#13;&#10;their minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing&#13;&#10;better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning&#13;&#10;hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news&#13;&#10;the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some&#13;&#10;from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with&#13;&#10;news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the&#13;&#10;neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the&#13;&#10;headquarters.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most&#13;&#10;interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge&#13;&#10;of the officers’ names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a&#13;&#10;secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr.&#13;&#10;Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of&#13;&#10;felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and&#13;&#10;Mr. Bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation&#13;&#10;to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the&#13;&#10;regimentals of an ensign.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.&#13;&#10;Bennet coolly observed:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two&#13;&#10;of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but&#13;&#10;I am now convinced.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect&#13;&#10;indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter,&#13;&#10;and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the&#13;&#10;next morning to London.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so&#13;&#10;ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly&#13;&#10;of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I&#13;&#10;had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must&#13;&#10;so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly&#13;&#10;foolish.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of&#13;&#10;their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will&#13;&#10;not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when&#13;&#10;I liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my&#13;&#10;heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,&#13;&#10;should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought&#13;&#10;Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in&#13;&#10;his regimentals.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain&#13;&#10;Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when they first&#13;&#10;came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with&#13;&#10;a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited&#13;&#10;for an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was&#13;&#10;eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,&#13;&#10;Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“MY DEAR FRIEND,--&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me,&#13;&#10;we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives,&#13;&#10;for a whole day’s tete-a-tete between two women can never end without a&#13;&#10;quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the&#13;&#10;gentlemen are to dine with the officers.--Yours ever,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“CAROLINE BINGLEY”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“With the officers!” cried Lydia. “I wonder my aunt did not tell us of&#13;&#10;_that_.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that is very unlucky.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to&#13;&#10;rain; and then you must stay all night.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that&#13;&#10;they would not offer to send her home.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to Meryton,&#13;&#10;and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I had much rather go in the coach.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are&#13;&#10;wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s purpose&#13;&#10;will be answered.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses&#13;&#10;were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her&#13;&#10;mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a&#13;&#10;bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before&#13;&#10;it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was&#13;&#10;delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;&#13;&#10;Jane certainly could not come back.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet more than&#13;&#10;once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the&#13;&#10;next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her&#13;&#10;contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield&#13;&#10;brought the following note for Elizabeth:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“MY DEAREST LIZZY,--&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be&#13;&#10;imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not&#13;&#10;hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr.&#13;&#10;Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been&#13;&#10;to me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the&#13;&#10;matter with me.--Yours, etc.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note&#13;&#10;aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she&#13;&#10;should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of&#13;&#10;Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling&#13;&#10;colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is&#13;&#10;all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though&#13;&#10;the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking&#13;&#10;was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a&#13;&#10;thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get&#13;&#10;there.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the&#13;&#10;horses?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing&#13;&#10;when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every&#13;&#10;impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,&#13;&#10;exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.&#13;&#10;Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off&#13;&#10;together.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may&#13;&#10;see something of Captain Carter before he goes.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one&#13;&#10;of the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing&#13;&#10;field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing&#13;&#10;over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last&#13;&#10;within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face&#13;&#10;glowing with the warmth of exercise.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were&#13;&#10;assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.&#13;&#10;That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such&#13;&#10;dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and&#13;&#10;Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt&#13;&#10;for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their&#13;&#10;brother’s manners there was something better than politeness; there&#13;&#10;was good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.&#13;&#10;Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the&#13;&#10;brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as&#13;&#10;to the occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was&#13;&#10;thinking only of his breakfast.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss&#13;&#10;Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not&#13;&#10;well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her&#13;&#10;immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving&#13;&#10;alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed&#13;&#10;for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,&#13;&#10;however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them&#13;&#10;together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the&#13;&#10;extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended&#13;&#10;her.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth&#13;&#10;began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and&#13;&#10;solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having&#13;&#10;examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught&#13;&#10;a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;&#13;&#10;advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice&#13;&#10;was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head&#13;&#10;ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were&#13;&#10;the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in&#13;&#10;fact, nothing to do elsewhere.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very&#13;&#10;unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only&#13;&#10;wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern&#13;&#10;in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer&#13;&#10;of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.&#13;&#10;Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to&#13;&#10;Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply&#13;&#10;of clothes.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 8&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six&#13;&#10;Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then&#13;&#10;poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the&#13;&#10;much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley’s, she could not make a very&#13;&#10;favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing&#13;&#10;this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how&#13;&#10;shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked&#13;&#10;being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their&#13;&#10;indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored&#13;&#10;Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could&#13;&#10;regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his&#13;&#10;attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling&#13;&#10;herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the&#13;&#10;others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was&#13;&#10;engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.&#13;&#10;Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to&#13;&#10;eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain&#13;&#10;dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley&#13;&#10;began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were&#13;&#10;pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;&#13;&#10;she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the&#13;&#10;same, and added:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent&#13;&#10;walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really&#13;&#10;looked almost wild.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very&#13;&#10;nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the&#13;&#10;country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep&#13;&#10;in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to&#13;&#10;hide it not doing its office.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was&#13;&#10;all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably&#13;&#10;well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite&#13;&#10;escaped my notice.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am&#13;&#10;inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your_ sister make such&#13;&#10;an exhibition.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Certainly not.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,&#13;&#10;above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by&#13;&#10;it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,&#13;&#10;a most country-town indifference to decorum.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said&#13;&#10;Bingley.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, “that&#13;&#10;this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Not at all,” he replied; “they were brightened by the exercise.” A&#13;&#10;short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very&#13;&#10;sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with&#13;&#10;such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is&#13;&#10;no chance of it.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in&#13;&#10;Meryton.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“That is capital,” added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it&#13;&#10;would not make them one jot less agreeable.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any&#13;&#10;consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their&#13;&#10;hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of&#13;&#10;their dear friend’s vulgar relations.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on&#13;&#10;leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.&#13;&#10;She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till&#13;&#10;late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and&#13;&#10;when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go&#13;&#10;downstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole&#13;&#10;party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting&#13;&#10;them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the&#13;&#10;excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay&#13;&#10;below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great&#13;&#10;reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I am&#13;&#10;_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and&#13;&#10;I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the&#13;&#10;table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her&#13;&#10;others--all that his library afforded.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own&#13;&#10;credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more&#13;&#10;than I ever looked into.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those&#13;&#10;in the room.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left&#13;&#10;so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at&#13;&#10;Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It ought to be good,” he replied, “it has been the work of many&#13;&#10;generations.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying&#13;&#10;books.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as&#13;&#10;these.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of&#13;&#10;that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be&#13;&#10;half as delightful as Pemberley.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I wish it may.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that&#13;&#10;neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a&#13;&#10;finer county in England than Derbyshire.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get&#13;&#10;Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very&#13;&#10;little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew&#13;&#10;near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his&#13;&#10;eldest sister, to observe the game.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley; “will&#13;&#10;she be as tall as I am?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, or&#13;&#10;rather taller.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me&#13;&#10;so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished&#13;&#10;for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience&#13;&#10;to be so very accomplished as they all are.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and&#13;&#10;net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure&#13;&#10;I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being&#13;&#10;informed that she was very accomplished.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has&#13;&#10;too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no&#13;&#10;otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very&#13;&#10;far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I&#13;&#10;cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my&#13;&#10;acquaintance, that are really accomplished.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your&#13;&#10;idea of an accomplished woman.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really&#13;&#10;esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met&#13;&#10;with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,&#13;&#10;dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides&#13;&#10;all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of&#13;&#10;walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word&#13;&#10;will be but half-deserved.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“All this she must possess,” added Darcy, “and to all this she must&#13;&#10;yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by&#13;&#10;extensive reading.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.&#13;&#10;I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all&#13;&#10;this?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and&#13;&#10;application, and elegance, as you describe united.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her&#13;&#10;implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who&#13;&#10;answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with&#13;&#10;bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all&#13;&#10;conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the&#13;&#10;room.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Elizabeth Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,&#13;&#10;“is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the&#13;&#10;other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it&#13;&#10;succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,&#13;&#10;“there is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend&#13;&#10;to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is&#13;&#10;despicable.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to&#13;&#10;continue the subject.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and&#13;&#10;that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for&#13;&#10;immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could&#13;&#10;be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most&#13;&#10;eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so&#13;&#10;unwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled&#13;&#10;that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet&#13;&#10;were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters&#13;&#10;declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,&#13;&#10;however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief&#13;&#10;to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every&#13;&#10;attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 9&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the&#13;&#10;morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the&#13;&#10;inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,&#13;&#10;and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his&#13;&#10;sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a&#13;&#10;note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her&#13;&#10;own judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and&#13;&#10;its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her&#13;&#10;two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been&#13;&#10;very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was&#13;&#10;not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her&#13;&#10;restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She&#13;&#10;would not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried&#13;&#10;home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think&#13;&#10;it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss&#13;&#10;Bingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all&#13;&#10;attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes&#13;&#10;that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be&#13;&#10;moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass&#13;&#10;a little longer on your kindness.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I am&#13;&#10;sure, will not hear of her removal.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You may depend upon it, Madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,&#13;&#10;“that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she&#13;&#10;remains with us.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends I do not&#13;&#10;know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers&#13;&#10;a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is&#13;&#10;always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest&#13;&#10;temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are&#13;&#10;nothing to _her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a&#13;&#10;charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the&#13;&#10;country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it&#13;&#10;in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I&#13;&#10;should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five&#13;&#10;minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen&#13;&#10;through I am afraid is pitiful.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate&#13;&#10;character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in&#13;&#10;the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I did not know before,” continued Bingley immediately, “that you were a&#13;&#10;studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at&#13;&#10;least that advantage.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but a few subjects for&#13;&#10;such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and&#13;&#10;unvarying society.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be&#13;&#10;observed in them for ever.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning&#13;&#10;a country neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of _that_&#13;&#10;going on in the country as in town.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,&#13;&#10;turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete&#13;&#10;victory over him, continued her triumph.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for&#13;&#10;my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal&#13;&#10;pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it;&#13;&#10;and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their&#13;&#10;advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But that&#13;&#10;gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing&#13;&#10;at all.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her&#13;&#10;mother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not&#13;&#10;such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,&#13;&#10;which you must acknowledge to be true.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting&#13;&#10;with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few&#13;&#10;neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his&#13;&#10;countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards&#13;&#10;Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of&#13;&#10;saying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if&#13;&#10;Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir&#13;&#10;William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So&#13;&#10;genteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_&#13;&#10;is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very&#13;&#10;important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Did Charlotte dine with you?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For&#13;&#10;my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work;&#13;&#10;_my_ daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to&#13;&#10;judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls,&#13;&#10;I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think&#13;&#10;Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“She seems a very pleasant young woman.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself&#13;&#10;has often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not like to boast&#13;&#10;of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody&#13;&#10;better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own&#13;&#10;partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother&#13;&#10;Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was&#13;&#10;sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he&#13;&#10;did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses&#13;&#10;on her, and very pretty they were.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth impatiently. “There has&#13;&#10;been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first&#13;&#10;discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said Darcy.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is&#13;&#10;strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I&#13;&#10;am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth&#13;&#10;tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to&#13;&#10;speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.&#13;&#10;Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to&#13;&#10;Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was&#13;&#10;unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be&#13;&#10;civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part&#13;&#10;indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and&#13;&#10;soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of&#13;&#10;her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to&#13;&#10;each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the&#13;&#10;youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming&#13;&#10;into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion&#13;&#10;and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose&#13;&#10;affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high&#13;&#10;animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the&#13;&#10;attention of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners, and her own&#13;&#10;easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very&#13;&#10;equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and&#13;&#10;abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most&#13;&#10;shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this&#13;&#10;sudden attack was delightful to their mother’s ear:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when&#13;&#10;your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of&#13;&#10;the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh! yes--it would be much better to&#13;&#10;wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter&#13;&#10;would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,” she&#13;&#10;added, “I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel&#13;&#10;Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned&#13;&#10;instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to the&#13;&#10;remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,&#13;&#10;could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of&#13;&#10;all Miss Bingley’s witticisms on _fine eyes_.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 10&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss&#13;&#10;Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who&#13;&#10;continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined&#13;&#10;their party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear.&#13;&#10;Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching&#13;&#10;the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by&#13;&#10;messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and&#13;&#10;Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in&#13;&#10;attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual&#13;&#10;commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness&#13;&#10;of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern&#13;&#10;with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was&#13;&#10;exactly in union with her opinion of each.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He made no answer.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You write uncommonly fast.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a&#13;&#10;year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I have already told her so once, by your desire.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend&#13;&#10;pens remarkably well.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Thank you--but I always mend my own.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“How can you contrive to write so even?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He was silent.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp;&#13;&#10;and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful&#13;&#10;little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss&#13;&#10;Grantley’s.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At&#13;&#10;present I have not room to do them justice.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you&#13;&#10;always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me&#13;&#10;to determine.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with&#13;&#10;ease, cannot write ill.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her&#13;&#10;brother, “because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much for&#13;&#10;words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My style of writing is very different from yours.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh!” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way&#13;&#10;imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which&#13;&#10;means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of&#13;&#10;humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an&#13;&#10;indirect boast.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in&#13;&#10;writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of&#13;&#10;thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you&#13;&#10;think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with&#13;&#10;quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any&#13;&#10;attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.&#13;&#10;Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield&#13;&#10;you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of&#13;&#10;panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very&#13;&#10;laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business&#13;&#10;undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the&#13;&#10;foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour,&#13;&#10;I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this&#13;&#10;moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless&#13;&#10;precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that&#13;&#10;you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as&#13;&#10;dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were&#13;&#10;mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better&#13;&#10;stay till next week,’ you would probably do it, you would probably not&#13;&#10;go--and at another word, might stay a month.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley did&#13;&#10;not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much&#13;&#10;more than he did himself.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what my&#13;&#10;friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am&#13;&#10;afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means&#13;&#10;intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a&#13;&#10;circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I&#13;&#10;could.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions&#13;&#10;as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for&#13;&#10;himself.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,&#13;&#10;but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to&#13;&#10;stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,&#13;&#10;that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and&#13;&#10;the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering&#13;&#10;one argument in favour of its propriety.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit&#13;&#10;with you.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of&#13;&#10;either.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of&#13;&#10;friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make&#13;&#10;one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason&#13;&#10;one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have&#13;&#10;supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the&#13;&#10;circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour&#13;&#10;thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,&#13;&#10;where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no&#13;&#10;very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying&#13;&#10;with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to&#13;&#10;arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to&#13;&#10;appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting&#13;&#10;between the parties?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not&#13;&#10;forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more&#13;&#10;weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure&#13;&#10;you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with&#13;&#10;myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not&#13;&#10;know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in&#13;&#10;particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,&#13;&#10;when he has nothing to do.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was&#13;&#10;rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly&#13;&#10;resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her&#13;&#10;brother for talking such nonsense.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an argument,&#13;&#10;and want to silence this.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss&#13;&#10;Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very&#13;&#10;thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.&#13;&#10;Darcy had much better finish his letter.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth&#13;&#10;for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity&#13;&#10;to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead&#13;&#10;the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she&#13;&#10;seated herself.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed,&#13;&#10;Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books&#13;&#10;that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy’s eyes were fixed&#13;&#10;on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of&#13;&#10;admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her&#13;&#10;because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine,&#13;&#10;however, at last that she drew his notice because there was something&#13;&#10;more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in&#13;&#10;any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked&#13;&#10;him too little to care for his approbation.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by&#13;&#10;a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, said to her:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an&#13;&#10;opportunity of dancing a reel?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some&#13;&#10;surprise at her silence.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh!” said she, “I heard you before, but I could not immediately&#13;&#10;determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say ‘Yes,’&#13;&#10;that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always&#13;&#10;delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of&#13;&#10;their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell&#13;&#10;you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if&#13;&#10;you dare.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Indeed I do not dare.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his&#13;&#10;gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her&#13;&#10;manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy&#13;&#10;had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really&#13;&#10;believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he&#13;&#10;should be in some danger.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great&#13;&#10;anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some&#13;&#10;assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of&#13;&#10;their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery&#13;&#10;the next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this&#13;&#10;desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;&#13;&#10;and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after&#13;&#10;officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to&#13;&#10;check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,&#13;&#10;which your lady possesses.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed&#13;&#10;in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the&#13;&#10;judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different&#13;&#10;lines. As for your Elizabeth’s picture, you must not have it taken, for&#13;&#10;what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their&#13;&#10;colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be&#13;&#10;copied.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and&#13;&#10;Elizabeth herself.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in some&#13;&#10;confusion, lest they had been overheard.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away without&#13;&#10;telling us that you were coming out.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk&#13;&#10;by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,&#13;&#10;and immediately said:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the&#13;&#10;avenue.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,&#13;&#10;laughingly answered:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear&#13;&#10;to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a&#13;&#10;fourth. Good-bye.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of&#13;&#10;being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered&#13;&#10;as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 11&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her&#13;&#10;sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the&#13;&#10;drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many&#13;&#10;professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable&#13;&#10;as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.&#13;&#10;Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an&#13;&#10;entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh&#13;&#10;at their acquaintance with spirit.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;&#13;&#10;Miss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had&#13;&#10;something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed&#13;&#10;himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also&#13;&#10;made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness&#13;&#10;and warmth remained for Bingley’s salutation. He was full of joy and&#13;&#10;attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she&#13;&#10;should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire&#13;&#10;to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from&#13;&#10;the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone&#13;&#10;else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great&#13;&#10;delight.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the&#13;&#10;card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.&#13;&#10;Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open&#13;&#10;petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and&#13;&#10;the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.&#13;&#10;Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the&#13;&#10;sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;&#13;&#10;and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets&#13;&#10;and rings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with Miss&#13;&#10;Bennet.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Miss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.&#13;&#10;Darcy’s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she&#13;&#10;was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She&#13;&#10;could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her&#13;&#10;question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be&#13;&#10;amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the&#13;&#10;second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant&#13;&#10;it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no&#13;&#10;enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a&#13;&#10;book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not&#13;&#10;an excellent library.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and&#13;&#10;cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing&#13;&#10;her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly&#13;&#10;towards him and said:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at&#13;&#10;Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult&#13;&#10;the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are&#13;&#10;not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a&#13;&#10;pleasure.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he&#13;&#10;chooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled&#13;&#10;thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send&#13;&#10;round my cards.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were&#13;&#10;carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably&#13;&#10;tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much&#13;&#10;more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of&#13;&#10;the day.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be&#13;&#10;near so much like a ball.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked&#13;&#10;about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but&#13;&#10;Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In&#13;&#10;the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and,&#13;&#10;turning to Elizabeth, said:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a&#13;&#10;turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so&#13;&#10;long in one attitude.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley&#13;&#10;succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked&#13;&#10;up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as&#13;&#10;Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was&#13;&#10;directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that&#13;&#10;he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down&#13;&#10;the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would&#13;&#10;interfere. “What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his&#13;&#10;meaning?”--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Not at all,” was her answer; “but depend upon it, he means to be severe&#13;&#10;on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing&#13;&#10;about it.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in&#13;&#10;anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his&#13;&#10;two motives.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon&#13;&#10;as she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this method of passing&#13;&#10;the evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret&#13;&#10;affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures&#13;&#10;appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be&#13;&#10;completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better&#13;&#10;as I sit by the fire.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything so&#13;&#10;abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. “We&#13;&#10;can all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate&#13;&#10;as you are, you must know how it is to be done.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has&#13;&#10;not yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and presence of&#13;&#10;mind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will&#13;&#10;not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a&#13;&#10;subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an&#13;&#10;uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would&#13;&#10;be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a&#13;&#10;laugh.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me more credit than can be.&#13;&#10;The wisest and the best of men--nay, the wisest and best of their&#13;&#10;actions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in&#13;&#10;life is a joke.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Certainly,” replied Elizabeth--“there are such people, but I hope I&#13;&#10;am not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.&#13;&#10;Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own,&#13;&#10;and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely&#13;&#10;what you are without.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study&#13;&#10;of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong&#13;&#10;understanding to ridicule.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Such as vanity and pride.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real&#13;&#10;superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss Bingley;&#13;&#10;“and pray what is the result?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it&#13;&#10;himself without disguise.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,&#13;&#10;but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch&#13;&#10;for. It is, I believe, too little yielding--certainly too little for the&#13;&#10;convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others&#13;&#10;so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings&#13;&#10;are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper&#13;&#10;would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost&#13;&#10;forever.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“_That_ is a failing indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable resentment&#13;&#10;_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I&#13;&#10;really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular&#13;&#10;evil--a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And _your_ defect is to hate everybody.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And yours,” he replied with a smile, “is willfully to misunderstand&#13;&#10;them.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of a&#13;&#10;conversation in which she had no share. “Louisa, you will not mind my&#13;&#10;waking Mr. Hurst?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was&#13;&#10;opened; and Darcy, after a few moments’ recollection, was not sorry for&#13;&#10;it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 12&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the&#13;&#10;next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for&#13;&#10;them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on&#13;&#10;her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which&#13;&#10;would exactly finish Jane’s week, could not bring herself to receive&#13;&#10;them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at&#13;&#10;least not to Elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.&#13;&#10;Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage&#13;&#10;before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley&#13;&#10;and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them&#13;&#10;very well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively&#13;&#10;resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the&#13;&#10;contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,&#13;&#10;she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley’s carriage immediately, and at&#13;&#10;length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield&#13;&#10;that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was&#13;&#10;said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work&#13;&#10;on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was&#13;&#10;then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike&#13;&#10;of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so&#13;&#10;soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be&#13;&#10;safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where&#13;&#10;she felt herself to be right.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at&#13;&#10;Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss&#13;&#10;Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teasing than usual to himself.&#13;&#10;He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration&#13;&#10;should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope&#13;&#10;of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been&#13;&#10;suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight&#13;&#10;in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke&#13;&#10;ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were&#13;&#10;at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most&#13;&#10;conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost&#13;&#10;all, took place. Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth increased at last&#13;&#10;very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,&#13;&#10;after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her&#13;&#10;to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most&#13;&#10;tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of&#13;&#10;the whole party in the liveliest of spirits.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet&#13;&#10;wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much&#13;&#10;trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their&#13;&#10;father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really&#13;&#10;glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The&#13;&#10;evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of&#13;&#10;its animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and&#13;&#10;Elizabeth.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human&#13;&#10;nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of&#13;&#10;threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information&#13;&#10;for them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been said&#13;&#10;in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers&#13;&#10;had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it&#13;&#10;had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 13&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I hope, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at&#13;&#10;breakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,&#13;&#10;because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,&#13;&#10;unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in--and I hope _my_ dinners&#13;&#10;are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled. “A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.&#13;&#10;Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.&#13;&#10;Bingley. But--good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be&#13;&#10;got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell--I must speak to Hill this&#13;&#10;moment.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom I&#13;&#10;never saw in the whole course of my life.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being&#13;&#10;eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago&#13;&#10;I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring&#13;&#10;early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead,&#13;&#10;may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.&#13;&#10;Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing&#13;&#10;in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own&#13;&#10;children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago&#13;&#10;to do something or other about it.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They&#13;&#10;had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which&#13;&#10;Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail&#13;&#10;bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of&#13;&#10;five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet, “and&#13;&#10;nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.&#13;&#10;But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little&#13;&#10;softened by his manner of expressing himself.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of&#13;&#10;him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false&#13;&#10;friends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did&#13;&#10;before him?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that&#13;&#10;head, as you will hear.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Dear Sir,--&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured&#13;&#10;father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the&#13;&#10;misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but&#13;&#10;for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might&#13;&#10;seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone&#13;&#10;with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--‘There, Mrs.&#13;&#10;Bennet.’--My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having&#13;&#10;received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be&#13;&#10;distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de&#13;&#10;Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has&#13;&#10;preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be&#13;&#10;my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her&#13;&#10;ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which&#13;&#10;are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I&#13;&#10;feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in&#13;&#10;all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I&#13;&#10;flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and&#13;&#10;that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate&#13;&#10;will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the&#13;&#10;offered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the&#13;&#10;means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for&#13;&#10;it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible&#13;&#10;amends--but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to&#13;&#10;receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting&#13;&#10;on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o’clock, and&#13;&#10;shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se’ennight&#13;&#10;following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine&#13;&#10;is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided&#13;&#10;that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.--I&#13;&#10;remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and&#13;&#10;daughters, your well-wisher and friend,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“WILLIAM COLLINS”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“At four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,”&#13;&#10; said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. “He seems to be a most&#13;&#10;conscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not will&#13;&#10;prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so&#13;&#10;indulgent as to let him come to us again.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if&#13;&#10;he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to&#13;&#10;discourage him.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can mean&#13;&#10;to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his&#13;&#10;credit.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady&#13;&#10;Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying&#13;&#10;his parishioners whenever it were required.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“He must be an oddity, I think,” said she. “I cannot make him&#13;&#10;out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he&#13;&#10;mean by apologising for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he&#13;&#10;would help it if he could.--Could he be a sensible man, sir?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the&#13;&#10;reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his&#13;&#10;letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“In point of composition,” said Mary, “the letter does not seem&#13;&#10;defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I&#13;&#10;think it is well expressed.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any&#13;&#10;degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should&#13;&#10;come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had&#13;&#10;received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for&#13;&#10;their mother, Mr. Collins’s letter had done away much of her ill-will,&#13;&#10;and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which&#13;&#10;astonished her husband and daughters.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great&#13;&#10;politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the&#13;&#10;ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in&#13;&#10;need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a&#13;&#10;tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and&#13;&#10;stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated&#13;&#10;before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of&#13;&#10;daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this&#13;&#10;instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did&#13;&#10;not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. This&#13;&#10;gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.&#13;&#10;Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may&#13;&#10;prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so&#13;&#10;oddly.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you&#13;&#10;must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things&#13;&#10;I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates&#13;&#10;will go when once they come to be entailed.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and&#13;&#10;could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing&#13;&#10;forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come&#13;&#10;prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps,&#13;&#10;when we are better acquainted--”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each&#13;&#10;other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins’s admiration. The&#13;&#10;hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;&#13;&#10;and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet’s&#13;&#10;heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his&#13;&#10;own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and&#13;&#10;he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its&#13;&#10;cooking was owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who&#13;&#10;assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a&#13;&#10;good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He&#13;&#10;begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared&#13;&#10;herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a&#13;&#10;quarter of an hour.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 14&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants&#13;&#10;were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his&#13;&#10;guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to&#13;&#10;shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady&#13;&#10;Catherine de Bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for&#13;&#10;his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen&#13;&#10;better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him&#13;&#10;to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect&#13;&#10;he protested that “he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in&#13;&#10;a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself&#13;&#10;experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to&#13;&#10;approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of&#13;&#10;preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,&#13;&#10;and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of&#13;&#10;quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many&#13;&#10;people he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.&#13;&#10;She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she&#13;&#10;made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the&#13;&#10;neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or&#13;&#10;two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to&#13;&#10;marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had&#13;&#10;once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly&#13;&#10;approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed&#13;&#10;to suggest some herself--some shelves in the closet up stairs.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and&#13;&#10;I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies&#13;&#10;in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane&#13;&#10;from Rosings Park, her ladyship’s residence.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very&#13;&#10;extensive property.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Ah!” said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than&#13;&#10;many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says&#13;&#10;that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the&#13;&#10;handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks&#13;&#10;the young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly&#13;&#10;constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many&#13;&#10;accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am&#13;&#10;informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still&#13;&#10;resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends&#13;&#10;to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at&#13;&#10;court.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;&#13;&#10;and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the&#13;&#10;British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased&#13;&#10;with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to&#13;&#10;offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable&#13;&#10;to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that&#13;&#10;her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most&#13;&#10;elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by&#13;&#10;her. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and&#13;&#10;it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to&#13;&#10;pay.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet, “and it is happy for you&#13;&#10;that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask&#13;&#10;whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the&#13;&#10;moment, or are the result of previous study?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I&#13;&#10;sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant&#13;&#10;compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to&#13;&#10;give them as unstudied an air as possible.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Bennet’s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd&#13;&#10;as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,&#13;&#10;maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,&#13;&#10;and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner&#13;&#10;in his pleasure.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad&#13;&#10;to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over,&#13;&#10;glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily&#13;&#10;assented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything&#13;&#10;announced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and&#13;&#10;begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at&#13;&#10;him, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some&#13;&#10;deliberation he chose Fordyce’s Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the&#13;&#10;volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three&#13;&#10;pages, she interrupted him with:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away&#13;&#10;Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me&#13;&#10;so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more&#13;&#10;about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.&#13;&#10;Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books&#13;&#10;of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes&#13;&#10;me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to&#13;&#10;them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at&#13;&#10;backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted&#13;&#10;very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.&#13;&#10;Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia’s&#13;&#10;interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would&#13;&#10;resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his&#13;&#10;young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any&#13;&#10;affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared&#13;&#10;for backgammon.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 15&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had&#13;&#10;been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part&#13;&#10;of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and&#13;&#10;miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he&#13;&#10;had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful&#13;&#10;acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had&#13;&#10;given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a&#13;&#10;good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in&#13;&#10;retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected&#13;&#10;prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de&#13;&#10;Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which&#13;&#10;he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,&#13;&#10;mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a&#13;&#10;clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of&#13;&#10;pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to&#13;&#10;marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had&#13;&#10;a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found&#13;&#10;them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.&#13;&#10;This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father’s&#13;&#10;estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and&#13;&#10;suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own&#13;&#10;part.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet’s lovely face&#13;&#10;confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what&#13;&#10;was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled&#13;&#10;choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a&#13;&#10;quarter of an hour’s tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a&#13;&#10;conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally&#13;&#10;to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at&#13;&#10;Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general&#13;&#10;encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. “As to&#13;&#10;her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could&#13;&#10;not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession; her&#13;&#10;_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her&#13;&#10;to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon&#13;&#10;done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally&#13;&#10;next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have&#13;&#10;two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of&#13;&#10;the day before was now high in her good graces.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister&#13;&#10;except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,&#13;&#10;at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,&#13;&#10;and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed&#13;&#10;him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with&#13;&#10;one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.&#13;&#10;Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such&#13;&#10;doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been&#13;&#10;always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the&#13;&#10;house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,&#13;&#10;was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their&#13;&#10;walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker&#13;&#10;than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his&#13;&#10;cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of&#13;&#10;the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were&#13;&#10;immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and&#13;&#10;nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in&#13;&#10;a shop window, could recall them.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom&#13;&#10;they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking&#13;&#10;with another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was&#13;&#10;the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came&#13;&#10;to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the&#13;&#10;stranger’s air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia,&#13;&#10;determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under&#13;&#10;pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately&#13;&#10;had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had&#13;&#10;reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated&#13;&#10;permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with&#13;&#10;him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a&#13;&#10;commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the&#13;&#10;young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.&#13;&#10;His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of&#13;&#10;beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.&#13;&#10;The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness&#13;&#10;of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and&#13;&#10;unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together&#13;&#10;very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy&#13;&#10;and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the&#13;&#10;ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and&#13;&#10;began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and&#13;&#10;Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to&#13;&#10;Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated&#13;&#10;it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes&#13;&#10;on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the&#13;&#10;stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they&#13;&#10;looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.&#13;&#10;Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham,&#13;&#10;after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just&#13;&#10;deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to&#13;&#10;imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what&#13;&#10;passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of&#13;&#10;Mr. Phillip’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia’s&#13;&#10;pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of&#13;&#10;Mrs. Phillips’s throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the&#13;&#10;invitation.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest,&#13;&#10;from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was&#13;&#10;eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as&#13;&#10;their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing&#13;&#10;about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones’s shop-boy in the&#13;&#10;street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to&#13;&#10;Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility&#13;&#10;was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him. She&#13;&#10;received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with&#13;&#10;as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous&#13;&#10;acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself,&#13;&#10;however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who&#13;&#10;introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an&#13;&#10;excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon&#13;&#10;put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom,&#13;&#10;however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that&#13;&#10;Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a&#13;&#10;lieutenant’s commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the&#13;&#10;last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.&#13;&#10;Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the&#13;&#10;occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the&#13;&#10;officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid,&#13;&#10;disagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses&#13;&#10;the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.&#13;&#10;Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn&#13;&#10;would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips&#13;&#10;protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery&#13;&#10;tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such&#13;&#10;delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.&#13;&#10;Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured&#13;&#10;with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass&#13;&#10;between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either&#13;&#10;or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain&#13;&#10;such behaviour than her sister.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring&#13;&#10;Mrs. Phillips’s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady&#13;&#10;Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman;&#13;&#10;for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even&#13;&#10;pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although&#13;&#10;utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be&#13;&#10;attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so&#13;&#10;much attention in the whole course of his life.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 16&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;As no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with their&#13;&#10;aunt, and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for&#13;&#10;a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach&#13;&#10;conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and&#13;&#10;the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,&#13;&#10;that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in&#13;&#10;the house.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.&#13;&#10;Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much&#13;&#10;struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he&#13;&#10;might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast&#13;&#10;parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much&#13;&#10;gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what&#13;&#10;Rosings was, and who was its proprietor--when she had listened to the&#13;&#10;description of only one of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found&#13;&#10;that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all&#13;&#10;the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison&#13;&#10;with the housekeeper’s room.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,&#13;&#10;with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and&#13;&#10;the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the&#13;&#10;gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive&#13;&#10;listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she&#13;&#10;heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as&#13;&#10;soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,&#13;&#10;and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine&#13;&#10;their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the&#13;&#10;interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.&#13;&#10;The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,&#13;&#10;Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking&#13;&#10;of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.&#13;&#10;The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,&#13;&#10;gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but&#13;&#10;Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and&#13;&#10;walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips,&#13;&#10;breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was&#13;&#10;turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated&#13;&#10;himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into&#13;&#10;conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel&#13;&#10;that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered&#13;&#10;interesting by the skill of the speaker.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the&#13;&#10;officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young&#13;&#10;ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind&#13;&#10;listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly&#13;&#10;supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he&#13;&#10;had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be glad&#13;&#10;to improve myself, for in my situation in life--” Mrs. Phillips was very&#13;&#10;glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he&#13;&#10;received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there&#13;&#10;seemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most&#13;&#10;determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,&#13;&#10;she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets&#13;&#10;and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.&#13;&#10;Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore&#13;&#10;at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear&#13;&#10;him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be&#13;&#10;told--the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not&#13;&#10;even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly&#13;&#10;relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far&#13;&#10;Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in&#13;&#10;a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject&#13;&#10;drop, added, “He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I&#13;&#10;understand.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes,” replied Mr. Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. A clear&#13;&#10;ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more&#13;&#10;capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for&#13;&#10;I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my&#13;&#10;infancy.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth could not but look surprised.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after&#13;&#10;seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting&#13;&#10;yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth very warmly. “I have&#13;&#10;spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very&#13;&#10;disagreeable.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being&#13;&#10;agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him&#13;&#10;too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_&#13;&#10;to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general&#13;&#10;astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly&#13;&#10;anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Upon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in&#13;&#10;the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in&#13;&#10;Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find&#13;&#10;him more favourably spoken of by anyone.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short&#13;&#10;interruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond&#13;&#10;their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The&#13;&#10;world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his&#13;&#10;high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an&#13;&#10;ill-tempered man.” Wickham only shook his head.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is&#13;&#10;likely to be in this country much longer.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I&#13;&#10;was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will&#13;&#10;not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_&#13;&#10;wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,&#13;&#10;and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for&#13;&#10;avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense&#13;&#10;of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he&#13;&#10;is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men&#13;&#10;that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never&#13;&#10;be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by&#13;&#10;a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been&#13;&#10;scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and&#13;&#10;everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the&#13;&#10;memory of his father.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with&#13;&#10;all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the&#13;&#10;neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that&#13;&#10;he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very&#13;&#10;intelligible gallantry.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added,&#13;&#10;“which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to be&#13;&#10;a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me&#13;&#10;further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great&#13;&#10;attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them.&#13;&#10;Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and&#13;&#10;my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.&#13;&#10;A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have&#13;&#10;now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I&#13;&#10;was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in&#13;&#10;possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we&#13;&#10;were speaking of just now.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Indeed!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best&#13;&#10;living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.&#13;&#10;I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,&#13;&#10;and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given&#13;&#10;elsewhere.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? How could his&#13;&#10;will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to&#13;&#10;give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the&#13;&#10;intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely&#13;&#10;conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim&#13;&#10;to it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing. Certain&#13;&#10;it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was&#13;&#10;of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no&#13;&#10;less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done&#13;&#10;anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and&#13;&#10;I may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely. I can&#13;&#10;recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort&#13;&#10;of men, and that he hates me.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I&#13;&#10;can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than&#13;&#10;ever as he expressed them.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive? What can&#13;&#10;have induced him to behave so cruelly?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but&#13;&#10;attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me&#13;&#10;less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon&#13;&#10;attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had&#13;&#10;not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort&#13;&#10;of preference which was often given me.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked&#13;&#10;him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be&#13;&#10;despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of&#13;&#10;descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as&#13;&#10;this.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;After a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_&#13;&#10;remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of&#13;&#10;his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition&#13;&#10;must be dreadful.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “I can hardly&#13;&#10;be just to him.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To&#13;&#10;treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his&#13;&#10;father!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like _you_, whose very&#13;&#10;countenance may vouch for your being amiable”--but she contented herself&#13;&#10;with, “and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood,&#13;&#10;connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest&#13;&#10;part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,&#13;&#10;sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_&#13;&#10;father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips,&#13;&#10;appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up everything to be of&#13;&#10;use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the&#13;&#10;Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most&#13;&#10;intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to&#13;&#10;be under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence,&#13;&#10;and when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a&#13;&#10;voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to&#13;&#10;be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his affection to myself.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“How strange!” cried Elizabeth. “How abominable! I wonder that the very&#13;&#10;pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better&#13;&#10;motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest--for&#13;&#10;dishonesty I must call it.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham, “for almost all his actions may&#13;&#10;be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has&#13;&#10;connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are&#13;&#10;none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger&#13;&#10;impulses even than pride.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money&#13;&#10;freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the&#13;&#10;poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride--for he is very proud of what&#13;&#10;his father was--have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family,&#13;&#10;to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the&#13;&#10;Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,&#13;&#10;which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and&#13;&#10;careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up&#13;&#10;as the most attentive and best of brothers.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to&#13;&#10;speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother--very, very&#13;&#10;proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond&#13;&#10;of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is&#13;&#10;nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,&#13;&#10;and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father’s death, her&#13;&#10;home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her&#13;&#10;education.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not&#13;&#10;help reverting once more to the first, and saying:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,&#13;&#10;who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,&#13;&#10;be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you&#13;&#10;know Mr. Bingley?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Not at all.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.&#13;&#10;Darcy is.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not&#13;&#10;want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth&#13;&#10;his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is&#13;&#10;a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His&#13;&#10;pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,&#13;&#10;sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing something&#13;&#10;for fortune and figure.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round&#13;&#10;the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin&#13;&#10;Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success were&#13;&#10;made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every&#13;&#10;point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon,&#13;&#10;he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least&#13;&#10;importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged&#13;&#10;that she would not make herself uneasy.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a&#13;&#10;card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I&#13;&#10;am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There&#13;&#10;are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady&#13;&#10;Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding&#13;&#10;little matters.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for&#13;&#10;a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation&#13;&#10;was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him&#13;&#10;a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her&#13;&#10;notice, but he certainly has not known her long.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy&#13;&#10;were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine’s&#13;&#10;connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before&#13;&#10;yesterday.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is&#13;&#10;believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss&#13;&#10;Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her&#13;&#10;affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already&#13;&#10;self-destined for another.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Mr. Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her&#13;&#10;daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,&#13;&#10;I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his&#13;&#10;patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I have&#13;&#10;not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked&#13;&#10;her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the&#13;&#10;reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe&#13;&#10;she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from&#13;&#10;her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her&#13;&#10;nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an&#13;&#10;understanding of the first class.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and&#13;&#10;they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper&#13;&#10;put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.&#13;&#10;Wickham’s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise&#13;&#10;of Mrs. Phillips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to&#13;&#10;everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done&#13;&#10;gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could&#13;&#10;think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all&#13;&#10;the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name&#13;&#10;as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia&#13;&#10;talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the&#13;&#10;fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and&#13;&#10;Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses&#13;&#10;at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing&#13;&#10;that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage&#13;&#10;before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 17&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr.&#13;&#10;Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she&#13;&#10;knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.&#13;&#10;Bingley’s regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the&#13;&#10;veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The&#13;&#10;possibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to&#13;&#10;interest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be&#13;&#10;done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each,&#13;&#10;and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be&#13;&#10;otherwise explained.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some way&#13;&#10;or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps&#13;&#10;misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to&#13;&#10;conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,&#13;&#10;without actual blame on either side.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on&#13;&#10;behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the&#13;&#10;business? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of&#13;&#10;somebody.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my&#13;&#10;opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light&#13;&#10;it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such&#13;&#10;a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is&#13;&#10;impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his&#13;&#10;character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so&#13;&#10;excessively deceived in him? Oh! no.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on, than&#13;&#10;that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me&#13;&#10;last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it&#13;&#10;be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his&#13;&#10;looks.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It is difficult indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to&#13;&#10;think.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But Jane could think with certainty on only one point--that Mr. Bingley,&#13;&#10;if he _had_ been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair&#13;&#10;became public.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this&#13;&#10;conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had&#13;&#10;been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal&#13;&#10;invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed&#13;&#10;for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their&#13;&#10;dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly&#13;&#10;asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To&#13;&#10;the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet&#13;&#10;as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to&#13;&#10;the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an&#13;&#10;activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if&#13;&#10;eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every&#13;&#10;female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in&#13;&#10;compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered&#13;&#10;by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a&#13;&#10;ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the&#13;&#10;society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and&#13;&#10;Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.&#13;&#10;Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy’s look&#13;&#10;and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended&#13;&#10;less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they&#13;&#10;each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,&#13;&#10;he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball&#13;&#10;was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she&#13;&#10;had no disinclination for it.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough--I&#13;&#10;think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.&#13;&#10;Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those&#13;&#10;who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for&#13;&#10;everybody.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth’s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did&#13;&#10;not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking&#13;&#10;him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s invitation, and if&#13;&#10;he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening’s&#13;&#10;amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no&#13;&#10;scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke&#13;&#10;either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to&#13;&#10;dance.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball&#13;&#10;of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people,&#13;&#10;can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing&#13;&#10;myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair&#13;&#10;cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of&#13;&#10;soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,&#13;&#10;a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right&#13;&#10;cause, and not to any disrespect for her.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being&#13;&#10;engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins&#13;&#10;instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help&#13;&#10;for it, however. Mr. Wickham’s happiness and her own were perforce&#13;&#10;delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins’s proposal accepted with as&#13;&#10;good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his&#13;&#10;gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first&#13;&#10;struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy&#13;&#10;of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a&#13;&#10;quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.&#13;&#10;The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing&#13;&#10;civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a&#13;&#10;compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than&#13;&#10;gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before&#13;&#10;her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage&#13;&#10;was extremely agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose&#13;&#10;to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the&#13;&#10;consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and&#13;&#10;till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the&#13;&#10;younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this&#13;&#10;time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there&#13;&#10;was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton&#13;&#10;once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after--the very&#13;&#10;shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have&#13;&#10;found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the&#13;&#10;improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than&#13;&#10;a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and&#13;&#10;Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 18&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in&#13;&#10;vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a&#13;&#10;doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty&#13;&#10;of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that&#13;&#10;might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than&#13;&#10;usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all&#13;&#10;that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than&#13;&#10;might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose&#13;&#10;the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy’s&#13;&#10;pleasure in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though&#13;&#10;this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was&#13;&#10;pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who&#13;&#10;told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the&#13;&#10;day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,&#13;&#10;“I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if&#13;&#10;he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for&#13;&#10;Wickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every&#13;&#10;feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate&#13;&#10;disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to&#13;&#10;the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.&#13;&#10;Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She&#13;&#10;was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away&#13;&#10;with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in&#13;&#10;speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect&#13;&#10;of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her&#13;&#10;spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had&#13;&#10;not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition&#13;&#10;to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular&#13;&#10;notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress;&#13;&#10;they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,&#13;&#10;apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being&#13;&#10;aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable&#13;&#10;partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from&#13;&#10;him was ecstasy.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of&#13;&#10;Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances&#13;&#10;were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with&#13;&#10;her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took&#13;&#10;her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that,&#13;&#10;without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again&#13;&#10;immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of&#13;&#10;mind; Charlotte tried to console her:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find&#13;&#10;a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an&#13;&#10;evil.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her&#13;&#10;hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a&#13;&#10;simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant&#13;&#10;in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no&#13;&#10;answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which&#13;&#10;she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and&#13;&#10;reading in her neighbours’ looks, their equal amazement in beholding&#13;&#10;it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to&#13;&#10;imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at&#13;&#10;first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would&#13;&#10;be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made&#13;&#10;some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again&#13;&#10;silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time&#13;&#10;with:--“It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked&#13;&#10;about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size&#13;&#10;of the room, or the number of couples.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be&#13;&#10;said.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may&#13;&#10;observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But&#13;&#10;_now_ we may be silent.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be&#13;&#10;entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of&#13;&#10;_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the&#13;&#10;trouble of saying as little as possible.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you&#13;&#10;imagine that you are gratifying mine?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great&#13;&#10;similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,&#13;&#10;taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say&#13;&#10;something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to&#13;&#10;posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,”&#13;&#10; said he. “How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_&#13;&#10;think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I must not decide on my own performance.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down&#13;&#10;the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often&#13;&#10;walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist&#13;&#10;the temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just&#13;&#10;been forming a new acquaintance.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his&#13;&#10;features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself&#13;&#10;for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a&#13;&#10;constrained manner said, “Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners&#13;&#10;as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of&#13;&#10;_retaining_ them, is less certain.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,” replied Elizabeth&#13;&#10;with emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all&#13;&#10;his life.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At&#13;&#10;that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass&#13;&#10;through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.&#13;&#10;Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on&#13;&#10;his dancing and his partner.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very&#13;&#10;superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the&#13;&#10;first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not&#13;&#10;disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,&#13;&#10;especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at&#13;&#10;her sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then&#13;&#10;flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir. You&#13;&#10;will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that&#13;&#10;young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir&#13;&#10;William’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his&#13;&#10;eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and&#13;&#10;Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,&#13;&#10;he turned to his partner, and said, “Sir William’s interruption has made&#13;&#10;me forget what we were talking of.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have&#13;&#10;interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.&#13;&#10;We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we&#13;&#10;are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“What think you of books?” said he, smiling.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Books--oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same&#13;&#10;feelings.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be&#13;&#10;no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of&#13;&#10;something else.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he,&#13;&#10;with a look of doubt.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said, for her&#13;&#10;thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared&#13;&#10;by her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,&#13;&#10;that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was&#13;&#10;unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being&#13;&#10;created_.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am,” said he, with a firm voice.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I hope not.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,&#13;&#10;to be secure of judging properly at first.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“May I ask to what these questions tend?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring&#13;&#10;to shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it out.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And what is your success?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such different&#13;&#10;accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I can readily believe,” answered he gravely, “that reports may vary&#13;&#10;greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were&#13;&#10;not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to&#13;&#10;fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another&#13;&#10;opportunity.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.&#13;&#10;She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in&#13;&#10;silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree,&#13;&#10;for in Darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards&#13;&#10;her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against&#13;&#10;another.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and&#13;&#10;with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!&#13;&#10;Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand&#13;&#10;questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among&#13;&#10;his other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late&#13;&#10;Mr. Darcy’s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to&#13;&#10;give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy’s&#13;&#10;using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has&#13;&#10;always been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated&#13;&#10;Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but&#13;&#10;I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he&#13;&#10;cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother&#13;&#10;thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to&#13;&#10;the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself&#13;&#10;out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent&#13;&#10;thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,&#13;&#10;Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really,&#13;&#10;considering his descent, one could not expect much better.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,” said&#13;&#10;Elizabeth angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse&#13;&#10;than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward, and of _that_, I can&#13;&#10;assure you, he informed me himself.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.&#13;&#10;“Excuse my interference--it was kindly meant.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much mistaken&#13;&#10;if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see&#13;&#10;nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.&#13;&#10;Darcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make&#13;&#10;inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of&#13;&#10;such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently&#13;&#10;marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.&#13;&#10;Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for&#13;&#10;Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way&#13;&#10;before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her&#13;&#10;sister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have&#13;&#10;been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case&#13;&#10;you may be sure of my pardon.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing&#13;&#10;satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of&#13;&#10;his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have&#13;&#10;principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,&#13;&#10;the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that&#13;&#10;Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has&#13;&#10;received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister’s,&#13;&#10;Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has&#13;&#10;been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s regard.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am&#13;&#10;satisfied. But what does he say of the living?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard&#13;&#10;them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to&#13;&#10;him _conditionally_ only.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly;&#13;&#10;“but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.&#13;&#10;Bingley’s defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but&#13;&#10;since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt&#13;&#10;the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of&#13;&#10;both gentlemen as I did before.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on&#13;&#10;which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with&#13;&#10;delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.&#13;&#10;Bingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence&#13;&#10;in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew&#13;&#10;to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last&#13;&#10;partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,&#13;&#10;and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as&#13;&#10;to make a most important discovery.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now&#13;&#10;in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the&#13;&#10;gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of&#13;&#10;the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady&#13;&#10;Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have&#13;&#10;thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de&#13;&#10;Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made&#13;&#10;in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to&#13;&#10;do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total&#13;&#10;ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.&#13;&#10;I believe him to be Lady Catherine’s _nephew_. It will be in my power to&#13;&#10;assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him&#13;&#10;that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction&#13;&#10;as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that&#13;&#10;it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either&#13;&#10;side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in&#13;&#10;consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her&#13;&#10;with the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she&#13;&#10;ceased speaking, replied thus:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in&#13;&#10;your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your&#13;&#10;understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide&#13;&#10;difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity,&#13;&#10;and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that&#13;&#10;I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with&#13;&#10;the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of&#13;&#10;behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to&#13;&#10;follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to&#13;&#10;perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to&#13;&#10;profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant&#13;&#10;guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by&#13;&#10;education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young&#13;&#10;lady like yourself.” And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.&#13;&#10;Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose&#13;&#10;astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced&#13;&#10;his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of&#13;&#10;it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the&#13;&#10;words “apology,” “Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed&#13;&#10;her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him&#13;&#10;with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time&#13;&#10;to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however,&#13;&#10;was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed&#13;&#10;abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the&#13;&#10;end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.&#13;&#10;Collins then returned to Elizabeth.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my&#13;&#10;reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered&#13;&#10;me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying&#13;&#10;that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to be&#13;&#10;certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very&#13;&#10;handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned&#13;&#10;her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the&#13;&#10;train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,&#13;&#10;made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in&#13;&#10;that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection&#13;&#10;could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of&#13;&#10;endeavouring even to like Bingley’s two sisters. Her mother’s thoughts&#13;&#10;she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to&#13;&#10;venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to&#13;&#10;supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which&#13;&#10;placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find&#13;&#10;that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,&#13;&#10;openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon&#13;&#10;be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet&#13;&#10;seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the&#13;&#10;match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but&#13;&#10;three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and&#13;&#10;then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of&#13;&#10;Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as&#13;&#10;she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger&#13;&#10;daughters, as Jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of&#13;&#10;other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be&#13;&#10;able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that&#13;&#10;she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was&#13;&#10;necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on&#13;&#10;such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.&#13;&#10;Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She&#13;&#10;concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally&#13;&#10;fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no&#13;&#10;chance of it.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’s&#13;&#10;words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible&#13;&#10;whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the&#13;&#10;chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her&#13;&#10;mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am&#13;&#10;sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say&#13;&#10;nothing _he_ may not like to hear.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you&#13;&#10;to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by&#13;&#10;so doing!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would&#13;&#10;talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and&#13;&#10;blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently&#13;&#10;glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what&#13;&#10;she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was&#13;&#10;convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression&#13;&#10;of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and&#13;&#10;steady gravity.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who&#13;&#10;had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no&#13;&#10;likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and&#13;&#10;chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of&#13;&#10;tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and&#13;&#10;she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,&#13;&#10;preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent&#13;&#10;entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,&#13;&#10;but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of&#13;&#10;exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth’s&#13;&#10;eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her&#13;&#10;progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very&#13;&#10;ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks&#13;&#10;of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to&#13;&#10;favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.&#13;&#10;Mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was&#13;&#10;weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at&#13;&#10;Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to&#13;&#10;Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs&#13;&#10;of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,&#13;&#10;imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his&#13;&#10;interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,&#13;&#10;and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, “That will do&#13;&#10;extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other&#13;&#10;young ladies have time to exhibit.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid&#13;&#10;her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I&#13;&#10;should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an&#13;&#10;air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly&#13;&#10;compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,&#13;&#10;to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time&#13;&#10;to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The&#13;&#10;rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make&#13;&#10;such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not&#13;&#10;offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time&#13;&#10;that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care&#13;&#10;and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making&#13;&#10;as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance&#13;&#10;that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody,&#13;&#10;especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit&#13;&#10;him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an&#13;&#10;occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the&#13;&#10;family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had&#13;&#10;been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared--many&#13;&#10;smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his&#13;&#10;wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly,&#13;&#10;and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably&#13;&#10;clever, good kind of young man.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to&#13;&#10;expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would&#13;&#10;have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or&#13;&#10;finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister&#13;&#10;that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his&#13;&#10;feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he&#13;&#10;must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should&#13;&#10;have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough,&#13;&#10;and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the&#13;&#10;gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by&#13;&#10;Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though&#13;&#10;he could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her&#13;&#10;power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with&#13;&#10;somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.&#13;&#10;He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;&#13;&#10;that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to&#13;&#10;her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her&#13;&#10;the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed&#13;&#10;her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and&#13;&#10;good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversation to herself.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy’s further notice;&#13;&#10;though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite&#13;&#10;disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the&#13;&#10;probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in&#13;&#10;it.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by&#13;&#10;a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of&#13;&#10;an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how&#13;&#10;heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her&#13;&#10;sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and&#13;&#10;were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed&#13;&#10;every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a&#13;&#10;languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the&#13;&#10;long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his&#13;&#10;sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and&#13;&#10;politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said&#13;&#10;nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.&#13;&#10;Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the&#13;&#10;rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a&#13;&#10;silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too&#13;&#10;much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord,&#13;&#10;how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly&#13;&#10;civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and&#13;&#10;addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he&#13;&#10;would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without&#13;&#10;the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure,&#13;&#10;and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on&#13;&#10;her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next&#13;&#10;day for a short time.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the&#13;&#10;delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of&#13;&#10;settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly&#13;&#10;see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four&#13;&#10;months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought&#13;&#10;with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.&#13;&#10;Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the&#13;&#10;man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each&#13;&#10;was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 19&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his&#13;&#10;declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as&#13;&#10;his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having&#13;&#10;no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at&#13;&#10;the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the&#13;&#10;observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On&#13;&#10;finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together,&#13;&#10;soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,&#13;&#10;when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the&#13;&#10;course of this morning?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.&#13;&#10;Bennet answered instantly, “Oh dear!--yes--certainly. I am sure Lizzy&#13;&#10;will be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I&#13;&#10;want you up stairs.” And, gathering her work together, she was hastening&#13;&#10;away, when Elizabeth called out:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse&#13;&#10;me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am&#13;&#10;going away myself.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.” And upon&#13;&#10;Elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to&#13;&#10;escape, she added: “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr.&#13;&#10;Collins.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment’s&#13;&#10;consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it&#13;&#10;over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to&#13;&#10;conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between&#13;&#10;distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as&#13;&#10;they were gone, Mr. Collins began.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from&#13;&#10;doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You&#13;&#10;would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little&#13;&#10;unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected&#13;&#10;mother’s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the&#13;&#10;purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to&#13;&#10;dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as&#13;&#10;soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of&#13;&#10;my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this&#13;&#10;subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for&#13;&#10;marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design&#13;&#10;of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away&#13;&#10;with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could&#13;&#10;not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further,&#13;&#10;and he continued:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for&#13;&#10;every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example&#13;&#10;of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will&#13;&#10;add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought&#13;&#10;to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and&#13;&#10;recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling&#13;&#10;patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked&#13;&#10;too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I&#13;&#10;left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was&#13;&#10;arranging Miss de Bourgh’s footstool, that she said, ‘Mr. Collins, you&#13;&#10;must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose&#13;&#10;a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,&#13;&#10;useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small&#13;&#10;income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as&#13;&#10;you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.’ Allow me, by the&#13;&#10;way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice&#13;&#10;and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the&#13;&#10;advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond&#13;&#10;anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be&#13;&#10;acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and&#13;&#10;respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general&#13;&#10;intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views&#13;&#10;were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I&#13;&#10;can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that&#13;&#10;being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured&#13;&#10;father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy&#13;&#10;myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that&#13;&#10;the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy&#13;&#10;event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not&#13;&#10;be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and&#13;&#10;I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing&#13;&#10;remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the&#13;&#10;violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and&#13;&#10;shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well&#13;&#10;aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds&#13;&#10;in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother’s&#13;&#10;decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,&#13;&#10;therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that&#13;&#10;no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget that I have made no&#13;&#10;answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for&#13;&#10;the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of&#13;&#10;your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to&#13;&#10;decline them.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the&#13;&#10;hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the&#13;&#10;man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their&#13;&#10;favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a&#13;&#10;third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just&#13;&#10;said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is a rather&#13;&#10;extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not&#13;&#10;one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so&#13;&#10;daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second&#13;&#10;time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_&#13;&#10;happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who&#13;&#10;could make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I&#13;&#10;am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the&#13;&#10;situation.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins&#13;&#10;very gravely--“but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all&#13;&#10;disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of&#13;&#10;seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your&#13;&#10;modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You&#13;&#10;must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment&#13;&#10;of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by&#13;&#10;refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.&#13;&#10;In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your&#13;&#10;feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn&#13;&#10;estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may&#13;&#10;be considered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she&#13;&#10;thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus&#13;&#10;addressed her:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I&#13;&#10;shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given&#13;&#10;me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I&#13;&#10;know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on&#13;&#10;the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to&#13;&#10;encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the&#13;&#10;female character.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth with some warmth, “you puzzle me&#13;&#10;exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form&#13;&#10;of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as&#13;&#10;to convince you of its being one.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your&#13;&#10;refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for&#13;&#10;believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is&#13;&#10;unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would&#13;&#10;be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections&#13;&#10;with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are&#13;&#10;circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further&#13;&#10;consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no&#13;&#10;means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your&#13;&#10;portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo&#13;&#10;the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must&#13;&#10;therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me,&#13;&#10;I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by&#13;&#10;suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind&#13;&#10;of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would&#13;&#10;rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you&#13;&#10;again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but&#13;&#10;to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect&#13;&#10;forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant&#13;&#10;female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking&#13;&#10;the truth from her heart.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward&#13;&#10;gallantry; “and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express&#13;&#10;authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of&#13;&#10;being acceptable.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make&#13;&#10;no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if&#13;&#10;he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering&#13;&#10;encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered&#13;&#10;in such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could&#13;&#10;not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 20&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his&#13;&#10;successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule&#13;&#10;to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open&#13;&#10;the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she&#13;&#10;entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in&#13;&#10;warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins&#13;&#10;received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then&#13;&#10;proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result&#13;&#10;of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the&#13;&#10;refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow&#13;&#10;from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been&#13;&#10;glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage&#13;&#10;him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,&#13;&#10;and could not help saying so.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be&#13;&#10;brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very&#13;&#10;headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will&#13;&#10;_make_ her know it.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but if&#13;&#10;she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would&#13;&#10;altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who&#13;&#10;naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she&#13;&#10;actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not&#13;&#10;to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of&#13;&#10;temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. “Lizzy is&#13;&#10;only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as&#13;&#10;good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and&#13;&#10;we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her&#13;&#10;husband, called out as she entered the library, “Oh! Mr. Bennet, you&#13;&#10;are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make&#13;&#10;Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you&#13;&#10;do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them&#13;&#10;on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by&#13;&#10;her communication.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she had&#13;&#10;finished her speech. “Of what are you talking?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,&#13;&#10;and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her&#13;&#10;marrying him.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the&#13;&#10;library.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared. “I have sent for&#13;&#10;you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made&#13;&#10;you an offer of marriage. Is it true?” Elizabeth replied that it was.&#13;&#10;“Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I have, sir.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your&#13;&#10;accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, or I will never see her again.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must&#13;&#10;be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you&#13;&#10;again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again&#13;&#10;if you _do_.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning,&#13;&#10;but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the&#13;&#10;affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to&#13;&#10;_insist_ upon her marrying him.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to request.&#13;&#10;First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the&#13;&#10;present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the&#13;&#10;library to myself as soon as may be.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did&#13;&#10;Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;&#13;&#10;coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane&#13;&#10;in her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined&#13;&#10;interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and&#13;&#10;sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner&#13;&#10;varied, however, her determination never did.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.&#13;&#10;He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin&#13;&#10;could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other&#13;&#10;way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her&#13;&#10;deserving her mother’s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend&#13;&#10;the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to&#13;&#10;her, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is such&#13;&#10;fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has&#13;&#10;made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,&#13;&#10;who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the&#13;&#10;breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on&#13;&#10;the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating&#13;&#10;her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her&#13;&#10;family. “Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,” she added in a melancholy tone,&#13;&#10;“for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used,&#13;&#10;nobody feels for my poor nerves.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Charlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Aye, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as unconcerned&#13;&#10;as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided&#13;&#10;she can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzy--if you take it&#13;&#10;into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,&#13;&#10;you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is&#13;&#10;to maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep&#13;&#10;you--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told&#13;&#10;you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,&#13;&#10;and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking&#13;&#10;to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking&#13;&#10;to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have&#13;&#10;no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it&#13;&#10;is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that&#13;&#10;any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the&#13;&#10;irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of&#13;&#10;them, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room with&#13;&#10;an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to&#13;&#10;the girls, “Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold&#13;&#10;your tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation&#13;&#10;together.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but&#13;&#10;Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,&#13;&#10;detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after&#13;&#10;herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little&#13;&#10;curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending&#13;&#10;not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected&#13;&#10;conversation: “Oh! Mr. Collins!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this point.&#13;&#10;Far be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice that marked his&#13;&#10;displeasure, “to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation&#13;&#10;to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a&#13;&#10;young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment;&#13;&#10;and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt&#13;&#10;of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand;&#13;&#10;for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as&#13;&#10;when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our&#13;&#10;estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect&#13;&#10;to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to&#13;&#10;your daughter’s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the&#13;&#10;compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my&#13;&#10;behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my&#13;&#10;dismission from your daughter’s lips instead of your own. But we are all&#13;&#10;liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.&#13;&#10;My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due&#13;&#10;consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_&#13;&#10;has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 21&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The discussion of Mr. Collins’s offer was now nearly at an end, and&#13;&#10;Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily&#13;&#10;attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her&#13;&#10;mother. As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly&#13;&#10;expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her,&#13;&#10;but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke&#13;&#10;to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of&#13;&#10;himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose&#13;&#10;civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and&#13;&#10;especially to her friend.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet’s ill-humour or ill&#13;&#10;health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth&#13;&#10;had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did&#13;&#10;not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on&#13;&#10;Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham&#13;&#10;were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.&#13;&#10;He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their&#13;&#10;aunt’s where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was&#13;&#10;well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged&#13;&#10;that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I found,” said he, “as the time drew near that I had better not meet&#13;&#10;Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so&#13;&#10;many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes&#13;&#10;might arise unpleasant to more than myself.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full&#13;&#10;discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly&#13;&#10;bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with&#13;&#10;them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to&#13;&#10;her. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the&#13;&#10;compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an&#13;&#10;occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came&#13;&#10;from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little,&#13;&#10;hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s fair, flowing hand; and&#13;&#10;Elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change as she read it, and saw&#13;&#10;her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected&#13;&#10;herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual&#13;&#10;cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety&#13;&#10;on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no&#13;&#10;sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane&#13;&#10;invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room,&#13;&#10;Jane, taking out the letter, said:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good&#13;&#10;deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on&#13;&#10;their way to town--and without any intention of coming back again. You&#13;&#10;shall hear what she says.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information&#13;&#10;of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,&#13;&#10;and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a&#13;&#10;house. The next was in these words: “I do not pretend to regret anything&#13;&#10;I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend;&#13;&#10;but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that&#13;&#10;delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may&#13;&#10;lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved&#13;&#10;correspondence. I depend on you for that.” To these highflown&#13;&#10;expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust;&#13;&#10;and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw&#13;&#10;nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their&#13;&#10;absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there; and as&#13;&#10;to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to&#13;&#10;regard it, in the enjoyment of his.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be&#13;&#10;able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not&#13;&#10;hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks&#13;&#10;forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful&#13;&#10;intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater&#13;&#10;satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by&#13;&#10;them.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into&#13;&#10;Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which&#13;&#10;took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we&#13;&#10;are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when&#13;&#10;Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have&#13;&#10;determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend&#13;&#10;his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are&#13;&#10;already there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my&#13;&#10;dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd--but of&#13;&#10;that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may&#13;&#10;abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your&#13;&#10;beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the&#13;&#10;three of whom we shall deprive you.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more this&#13;&#10;winter.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he _should_.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own&#13;&#10;master. But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which&#13;&#10;particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth,&#13;&#10;_we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think&#13;&#10;Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments;&#13;&#10;and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into&#13;&#10;something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of&#13;&#10;her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before&#13;&#10;mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the&#13;&#10;country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them&#13;&#10;unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have&#13;&#10;frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing;&#13;&#10;her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister’s&#13;&#10;partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most&#13;&#10;capable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all these circumstances to&#13;&#10;favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest&#13;&#10;Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness&#13;&#10;of so many?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“What do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said Jane as she&#13;&#10;finished it. “Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that&#13;&#10;Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is&#13;&#10;perfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference; and that if she&#13;&#10;suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to&#13;&#10;put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Most willingly.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is&#13;&#10;in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him&#13;&#10;to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he&#13;&#10;does not care about you.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Jane shook her head.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you&#13;&#10;together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She&#13;&#10;is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.&#13;&#10;Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the&#13;&#10;case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she&#13;&#10;is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion&#13;&#10;that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble&#13;&#10;in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and&#13;&#10;I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,&#13;&#10;my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley&#13;&#10;tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest&#13;&#10;degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on&#13;&#10;Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead&#13;&#10;of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your&#13;&#10;representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the&#13;&#10;foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving&#13;&#10;anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving&#13;&#10;herself.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you&#13;&#10;will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means.&#13;&#10;You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in&#13;&#10;accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry&#13;&#10;elsewhere?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon mature&#13;&#10;deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is&#13;&#10;more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by&#13;&#10;all means to refuse him.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling. “You must know that&#13;&#10;though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could&#13;&#10;not hesitate.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider&#13;&#10;your situation with much compassion.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be&#13;&#10;required. A thousand things may arise in six months!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost&#13;&#10;contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline’s&#13;&#10;interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those&#13;&#10;wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man&#13;&#10;so totally independent of everyone.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt&#13;&#10;on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.&#13;&#10;Jane’s temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,&#13;&#10;though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that&#13;&#10;Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the&#13;&#10;family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct;&#13;&#10;but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,&#13;&#10;and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen&#13;&#10;to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After&#13;&#10;lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.&#13;&#10;Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the&#13;&#10;conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had&#13;&#10;been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two&#13;&#10;full courses.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 22&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the&#13;&#10;chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.&#13;&#10;Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “It keeps him in good&#13;&#10;humour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can express.”&#13;&#10; Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and&#13;&#10;that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was&#13;&#10;very amiable, but Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth&#13;&#10;had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her&#13;&#10;from any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them towards&#13;&#10;herself. Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances were so&#13;&#10;favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost&#13;&#10;secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very&#13;&#10;soon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his&#13;&#10;character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next&#13;&#10;morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw&#13;&#10;himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,&#13;&#10;from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to&#13;&#10;conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known&#13;&#10;till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost&#13;&#10;secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,&#13;&#10;he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.&#13;&#10;His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas&#13;&#10;perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and&#13;&#10;instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had&#13;&#10;she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In as short a time as Mr. Collins’s long speeches would allow,&#13;&#10;everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as&#13;&#10;they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that&#13;&#10;was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must&#13;&#10;be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with&#13;&#10;his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must&#13;&#10;guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its&#13;&#10;continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure&#13;&#10;and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that&#13;&#10;establishment were gained.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;&#13;&#10;and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins’s present&#13;&#10;circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom&#13;&#10;they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were&#13;&#10;exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more&#13;&#10;interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer&#13;&#10;Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided&#13;&#10;opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the&#13;&#10;Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife&#13;&#10;should make their appearance at St. James’s. The whole family, in short,&#13;&#10;were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes&#13;&#10;of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have&#13;&#10;done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte’s&#13;&#10;dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had&#13;&#10;gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were&#13;&#10;in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible&#13;&#10;nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must&#13;&#10;be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly&#13;&#10;either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was&#13;&#10;the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune,&#13;&#10;and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest&#13;&#10;preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at&#13;&#10;the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all&#13;&#10;the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business&#13;&#10;was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship&#13;&#10;she valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder,&#13;&#10;and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be&#13;&#10;shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved&#13;&#10;to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins,&#13;&#10;when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had&#13;&#10;passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very&#13;&#10;dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the&#13;&#10;curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct&#13;&#10;questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was&#13;&#10;at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to&#13;&#10;publish his prosperous love.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the&#13;&#10;family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved&#13;&#10;for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality,&#13;&#10;said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever&#13;&#10;his engagements might allow him to visit them.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly&#13;&#10;gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and&#13;&#10;you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as&#13;&#10;possible.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for&#13;&#10;so speedy a return, immediately said:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s disapprobation here, my&#13;&#10;good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of&#13;&#10;offending your patroness.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you&#13;&#10;for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so&#13;&#10;material a step without her ladyship’s concurrence.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her&#13;&#10;displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us&#13;&#10;again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,&#13;&#10;and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such&#13;&#10;affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive&#13;&#10;from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your&#13;&#10;regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though&#13;&#10;my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now&#13;&#10;take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my&#13;&#10;cousin Elizabeth.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally&#13;&#10;surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to&#13;&#10;understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her&#13;&#10;younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.&#13;&#10;She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was&#13;&#10;a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no&#13;&#10;means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read&#13;&#10;and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very&#13;&#10;agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this&#13;&#10;kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a&#13;&#10;private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with her&#13;&#10;friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but&#13;&#10;that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from&#13;&#10;possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was&#13;&#10;consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and&#13;&#10;she could not help crying out:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte--impossible!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her&#13;&#10;story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a&#13;&#10;reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained&#13;&#10;her composure, and calmly replied:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible&#13;&#10;that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion,&#13;&#10;because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort&#13;&#10;for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of&#13;&#10;their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her&#13;&#10;all imaginable happiness.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte. “You must be surprised,&#13;&#10;very much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry&#13;&#10;you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be&#13;&#10;satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never&#13;&#10;was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins’s&#13;&#10;character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my&#13;&#10;chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on&#13;&#10;entering the marriage state.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth quietly answered “Undoubtedly;” and after an awkward pause,&#13;&#10;they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much&#13;&#10;longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.&#13;&#10;It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so&#13;&#10;unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins’s making two offers&#13;&#10;of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now&#13;&#10;accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was&#13;&#10;not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible&#13;&#10;that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better&#13;&#10;feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a&#13;&#10;most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself&#13;&#10;and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it&#13;&#10;was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had&#13;&#10;chosen.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 23&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what&#13;&#10;she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention&#13;&#10;it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to&#13;&#10;announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,&#13;&#10;and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the&#13;&#10;houses, he unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely wondering, but&#13;&#10;incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness,&#13;&#10;protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and&#13;&#10;often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know&#13;&#10;that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne&#13;&#10;without anger such treatment; but Sir William’s good breeding carried&#13;&#10;him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the&#13;&#10;truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the&#13;&#10;most forbearing courtesy.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant&#13;&#10;a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by&#13;&#10;mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and&#13;&#10;endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters&#13;&#10;by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she&#13;&#10;was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the&#13;&#10;happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character&#13;&#10;of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while&#13;&#10;Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings&#13;&#10;found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving&#13;&#10;the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins&#13;&#10;had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be&#13;&#10;happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two&#13;&#10;inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that&#13;&#10;Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she&#13;&#10;herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two&#13;&#10;points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could&#13;&#10;console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her&#13;&#10;resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without&#13;&#10;scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William&#13;&#10;or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she&#13;&#10;could at all forgive their daughter.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such&#13;&#10;as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for&#13;&#10;it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had&#13;&#10;been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and&#13;&#10;more foolish than his daughter!&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said&#13;&#10;less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;&#13;&#10;nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty&#13;&#10;and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a&#13;&#10;clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news&#13;&#10;to spread at Meryton.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort&#13;&#10;on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she&#13;&#10;called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,&#13;&#10;though Mrs. Bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been&#13;&#10;enough to drive happiness away.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them&#13;&#10;mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that&#13;&#10;no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her&#13;&#10;disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her&#13;&#10;sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could&#13;&#10;never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious,&#13;&#10;as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his&#13;&#10;return.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting&#13;&#10;the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised&#13;&#10;letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to&#13;&#10;their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a&#13;&#10;twelvemonth’s abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging&#13;&#10;his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many&#13;&#10;rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection&#13;&#10;of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was&#13;&#10;merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready&#13;&#10;to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither&#13;&#10;he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,&#13;&#10;he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take&#13;&#10;place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable&#13;&#10;argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him&#13;&#10;the happiest of men.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of&#13;&#10;pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to&#13;&#10;complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come&#13;&#10;to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient&#13;&#10;and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house&#13;&#10;while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the&#13;&#10;most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and&#13;&#10;they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued&#13;&#10;absence.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after&#13;&#10;day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the&#13;&#10;report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to&#13;&#10;Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.&#13;&#10;Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous&#13;&#10;falsehood.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that&#13;&#10;his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as&#13;&#10;she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane’s happiness, and so&#13;&#10;dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its&#13;&#10;frequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters&#13;&#10;and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss&#13;&#10;Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for&#13;&#10;the strength of his attachment.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more&#13;&#10;painful than Elizabeth’s, but whatever she felt she was desirous of&#13;&#10;concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject&#13;&#10;was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother,&#13;&#10;an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her&#13;&#10;impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he&#13;&#10;did not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed&#13;&#10;all Jane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable&#13;&#10;tranquillity.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his&#13;&#10;reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his&#13;&#10;first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;&#13;&#10;and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them&#13;&#10;from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by&#13;&#10;him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time&#13;&#10;to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of&#13;&#10;anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour,&#13;&#10;and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight&#13;&#10;of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she&#13;&#10;regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see&#13;&#10;them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and&#13;&#10;whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that&#13;&#10;they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself&#13;&#10;and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She&#13;&#10;complained bitterly of all this to her husband.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that Charlotte&#13;&#10;Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to&#13;&#10;make way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for&#13;&#10;better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of&#13;&#10;making any answer, she went on as before.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was&#13;&#10;not for the entail, I should not mind it.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“What should not you mind?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I should not mind anything at all.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such&#13;&#10;insensibility.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How&#13;&#10;anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one’s own&#13;&#10;daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!&#13;&#10;Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 24&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Miss Bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first&#13;&#10;sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for&#13;&#10;the winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret at not having had&#13;&#10;time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left&#13;&#10;the country.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest&#13;&#10;of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the&#13;&#10;writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy’s praise occupied&#13;&#10;the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline&#13;&#10;boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict&#13;&#10;the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former&#13;&#10;letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an&#13;&#10;inmate of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of&#13;&#10;the latter with regard to new furniture.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,&#13;&#10;heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern&#13;&#10;for her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline’s&#13;&#10;assertion of her brother’s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no&#13;&#10;credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she&#13;&#10;had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she&#13;&#10;could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness&#13;&#10;of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave&#13;&#10;of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness&#13;&#10;to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however,&#13;&#10;been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in&#13;&#10;whatever manner he thought best, but her sister’s was involved in it, as&#13;&#10;she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short,&#13;&#10;on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She&#13;&#10;could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley’s regard had really&#13;&#10;died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference; whether&#13;&#10;he had been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had escaped his&#13;&#10;observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be&#13;&#10;materially affected by the difference, her sister’s situation remained&#13;&#10;the same, her peace equally wounded.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to&#13;&#10;Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them together, after a&#13;&#10;longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could&#13;&#10;not help saying:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no&#13;&#10;idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But&#13;&#10;I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall&#13;&#10;all be as we were before.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said&#13;&#10;nothing.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have&#13;&#10;no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my&#13;&#10;acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear,&#13;&#10;and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not _that_ pain. A&#13;&#10;little time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort immediately,&#13;&#10;that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it&#13;&#10;has done no harm to anyone but myself.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My dear Jane!” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good. Your sweetness&#13;&#10;and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say&#13;&#10;to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you&#13;&#10;deserve.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back&#13;&#10;the praise on her sister’s warm affection.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the&#13;&#10;world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want&#13;&#10;to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not&#13;&#10;be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your&#13;&#10;privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people&#13;&#10;whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see&#13;&#10;of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms&#13;&#10;my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the&#13;&#10;little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or&#13;&#10;sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the&#13;&#10;other is Charlotte’s marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is&#13;&#10;unaccountable!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will&#13;&#10;ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference&#13;&#10;of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins’s respectability, and&#13;&#10;Charlotte’s steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a&#13;&#10;large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be&#13;&#10;ready to believe, for everybody’s sake, that she may feel something like&#13;&#10;regard and esteem for our cousin.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else&#13;&#10;could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that&#13;&#10;Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her&#13;&#10;understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a&#13;&#10;conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as&#13;&#10;I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him&#13;&#10;cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though&#13;&#10;it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,&#13;&#10;change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade&#13;&#10;yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of&#13;&#10;danger security for happiness.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,” replied&#13;&#10;Jane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy&#13;&#10;together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You&#13;&#10;mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat&#13;&#10;you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and&#13;&#10;saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy&#13;&#10;ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man&#13;&#10;to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but&#13;&#10;our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than&#13;&#10;it does.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And men take care that they should.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea&#13;&#10;of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s conduct to design,”&#13;&#10; said Elizabeth; “but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others&#13;&#10;unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,&#13;&#10;want of attention to other people’s feelings, and want of resolution,&#13;&#10;will do the business.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And do you impute it to either of those?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what&#13;&#10;I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, in conjunction with his friend.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can&#13;&#10;only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can&#13;&#10;secure it.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his&#13;&#10;happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they&#13;&#10;may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great&#13;&#10;connections, and pride.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to choose Miss Darcy,” replied Jane;&#13;&#10;“but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have&#13;&#10;known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love&#13;&#10;her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely&#13;&#10;they should have opposed their brother’s. What sister would think&#13;&#10;herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very&#13;&#10;objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try&#13;&#10;to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an&#13;&#10;affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most&#13;&#10;unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been&#13;&#10;mistaken--or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what&#13;&#10;I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in&#13;&#10;the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley’s&#13;&#10;name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no&#13;&#10;more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account&#13;&#10;for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with&#13;&#10;less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she&#13;&#10;did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the&#13;&#10;effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her&#13;&#10;no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at&#13;&#10;the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet’s best&#13;&#10;comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. “So, Lizzy,” said he one day,&#13;&#10;“your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to&#13;&#10;being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then.&#13;&#10;It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction&#13;&#10;among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to&#13;&#10;be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in&#13;&#10;Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham&#13;&#10;be _your_ man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not&#13;&#10;all expect Jane’s good fortune.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“True,” said Mr. Bennet, “but it is a comfort to think that whatever of&#13;&#10;that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make&#13;&#10;the most of it.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom&#13;&#10;which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn&#13;&#10;family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now&#13;&#10;added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already&#13;&#10;heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,&#13;&#10;was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was&#13;&#10;pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they&#13;&#10;had known anything of the matter.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be&#13;&#10;any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society&#13;&#10;of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for&#13;&#10;allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else&#13;&#10;Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 25&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity,&#13;&#10;Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of&#13;&#10;Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his&#13;&#10;side, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason&#13;&#10;to hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would&#13;&#10;be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his&#13;&#10;relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair&#13;&#10;cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another&#13;&#10;letter of thanks.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving&#13;&#10;her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas&#13;&#10;at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly&#13;&#10;superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield&#13;&#10;ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived&#13;&#10;by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so&#13;&#10;well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger&#13;&#10;than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant&#13;&#10;woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the&#13;&#10;two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard.&#13;&#10;They had frequently been staying with her in town.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The first part of Mrs. Gardiner’s business on her arrival was to&#13;&#10;distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was&#13;&#10;done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.&#13;&#10;Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They&#13;&#10;had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her&#13;&#10;girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was&#13;&#10;nothing in it.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I do not blame Jane,” she continued, “for Jane would have got Mr.&#13;&#10;Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think&#13;&#10;that she might have been Mr. Collins’s wife by this time, had it not&#13;&#10;been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,&#13;&#10;and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have&#13;&#10;a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just&#13;&#10;as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed,&#13;&#10;sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of&#13;&#10;them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted&#13;&#10;so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves&#13;&#10;before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the&#13;&#10;greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of&#13;&#10;long sleeves.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before,&#13;&#10;in the course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with her, made her&#13;&#10;sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the&#13;&#10;conversation.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. “It&#13;&#10;seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,” said she. “I am&#13;&#10;sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such&#13;&#10;as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl&#13;&#10;for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets&#13;&#10;her, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“An excellent consolation in its way,” said Elizabeth, “but it will not&#13;&#10;do for _us_. We do not suffer by _accident_. It does not often&#13;&#10;happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of&#13;&#10;independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in&#13;&#10;love with only a few days before.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, so&#13;&#10;doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as&#13;&#10;often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour’s acquaintance,&#13;&#10;as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley’s&#13;&#10;love?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite&#13;&#10;inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time&#13;&#10;they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he&#13;&#10;offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I&#13;&#10;spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be&#13;&#10;finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor&#13;&#10;Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get&#13;&#10;over it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you&#13;&#10;would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she&#13;&#10;would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be&#13;&#10;of service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as&#13;&#10;anything.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded&#13;&#10;of her sister’s ready acquiescence.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with regard to&#13;&#10;this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of&#13;&#10;town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go&#13;&#10;out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all,&#13;&#10;unless he really comes to see her.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his&#13;&#10;friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such&#13;&#10;a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may&#13;&#10;perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he&#13;&#10;would hardly think a month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its&#13;&#10;impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley&#13;&#10;never stirs without him.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane&#13;&#10;correspond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“She will drop the acquaintance entirely.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this&#13;&#10;point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley’s being&#13;&#10;withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which&#13;&#10;convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely&#13;&#10;hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that&#13;&#10;his affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends&#13;&#10;successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane’s&#13;&#10;attractions.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Miss Bennet accepted her aunt’s invitation with pleasure; and the&#13;&#10;Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she&#13;&#10;hoped by Caroline’s not living in the same house with her brother,&#13;&#10;she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of&#13;&#10;seeing him.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses,&#13;&#10;the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its&#13;&#10;engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment&#13;&#10;of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family&#13;&#10;dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always&#13;&#10;made part of it--of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and&#13;&#10;on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth’s&#13;&#10;warm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them,&#13;&#10;from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference&#13;&#10;of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and&#13;&#10;she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left&#13;&#10;Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such&#13;&#10;an attachment.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,&#13;&#10;unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,&#13;&#10;before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very&#13;&#10;part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many&#13;&#10;acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since&#13;&#10;the death of Darcy’s father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher&#13;&#10;intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of&#13;&#10;procuring.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by&#13;&#10;character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject&#13;&#10;of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute&#13;&#10;description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of&#13;&#10;praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both&#13;&#10;him and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy’s&#13;&#10;treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman’s&#13;&#10;reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and&#13;&#10;was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam&#13;&#10;Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 26&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Gardiner’s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given&#13;&#10;on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after&#13;&#10;honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because&#13;&#10;you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking&#13;&#10;openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve&#13;&#10;yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want&#13;&#10;of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against&#13;&#10;_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he&#13;&#10;ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you&#13;&#10;must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all&#13;&#10;expect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and&#13;&#10;good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of&#13;&#10;myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I&#13;&#10;can prevent it.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Elizabeth, you are not serious now.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with&#13;&#10;Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,&#13;&#10;the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to&#13;&#10;me--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence&#13;&#10;of it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father’s opinion of me does&#13;&#10;me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My&#13;&#10;father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I&#13;&#10;should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but&#13;&#10;since we see every day that where there is affection, young people&#13;&#10;are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into&#13;&#10;engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many&#13;&#10;of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it&#13;&#10;would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not&#13;&#10;to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first&#13;&#10;object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short,&#13;&#10;I will do my best.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very&#13;&#10;often. At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“As I did the other day,” said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: “very&#13;&#10;true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine&#13;&#10;that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been&#13;&#10;so frequently invited this week. You know my mother’s ideas as to the&#13;&#10;necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my&#13;&#10;honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope&#13;&#10;you are satisfied.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for&#13;&#10;the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice&#13;&#10;being given on such a point, without being resented.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted&#13;&#10;by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,&#13;&#10;his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was&#13;&#10;now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think&#13;&#10;it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that&#13;&#10;she “_wished_ they might be happy.” Thursday was to be the wedding day,&#13;&#10;and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she&#13;&#10;rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother’s ungracious and&#13;&#10;reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her&#13;&#10;out of the room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“_That_ you certainly shall.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to&#13;&#10;come to Hunsford.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the&#13;&#10;visit.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My father and Maria are coming to me in March,” added Charlotte, “and I&#13;&#10;hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as&#13;&#10;welcome as either of them.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from&#13;&#10;the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on&#13;&#10;the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their&#13;&#10;correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that&#13;&#10;it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never&#13;&#10;address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,&#13;&#10;and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the&#13;&#10;sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte’s first letters&#13;&#10;were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be&#13;&#10;curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would&#13;&#10;like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to&#13;&#10;be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte&#13;&#10;expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She&#13;&#10;wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing&#13;&#10;which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and&#13;&#10;roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine’s behaviour was most&#13;&#10;friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins’s picture of Hunsford and&#13;&#10;Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait&#13;&#10;for her own visit there to know the rest.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their&#13;&#10;safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it&#13;&#10;would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience&#13;&#10;generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or&#13;&#10;hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that&#13;&#10;her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been&#13;&#10;lost.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of the&#13;&#10;town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.&#13;&#10;“I did not think Caroline in spirits,” were her words, “but she was very&#13;&#10;glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming&#13;&#10;to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached&#13;&#10;her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much&#13;&#10;engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that&#13;&#10;Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was&#13;&#10;not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall&#13;&#10;see them soon here.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that&#13;&#10;accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister’s being in town.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to&#13;&#10;persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be&#13;&#10;blind to Miss Bingley’s inattention. After waiting at home every morning&#13;&#10;for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the&#13;&#10;visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,&#13;&#10;the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no&#13;&#10;longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will&#13;&#10;prove what she felt.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her&#13;&#10;better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been&#13;&#10;entirely deceived in Miss Bingley’s regard for me. But, my dear sister,&#13;&#10;though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I&#13;&#10;still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was&#13;&#10;as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for&#13;&#10;wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to&#13;&#10;happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not&#13;&#10;return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I&#13;&#10;receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that&#13;&#10;she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not&#13;&#10;calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was&#13;&#10;in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was&#13;&#10;perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity,&#13;&#10;though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out&#13;&#10;as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on&#13;&#10;her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting&#13;&#10;wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the&#13;&#10;cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know&#13;&#10;this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily&#13;&#10;account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to&#13;&#10;his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and&#13;&#10;amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now,&#13;&#10;because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.&#13;&#10;He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said&#13;&#10;herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she&#13;&#10;wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I&#13;&#10;cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should&#13;&#10;be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity&#13;&#10;in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought,&#13;&#10;and think only of what will make me happy--your affection, and the&#13;&#10;invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very&#13;&#10;soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield&#13;&#10;again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better&#13;&#10;not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts&#13;&#10;from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and&#13;&#10;Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.--Yours, etc.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she&#13;&#10;considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.&#13;&#10;All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not&#13;&#10;even wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on&#13;&#10;every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible&#13;&#10;advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.&#13;&#10;Darcy’s sister, as by Wickham’s account, she would make him abundantly&#13;&#10;regret what he had thrown away.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise&#13;&#10;concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth&#13;&#10;had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to&#13;&#10;herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,&#13;&#10;he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to&#13;&#10;see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.&#13;&#10;Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied&#13;&#10;with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune&#13;&#10;permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most&#13;&#10;remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself&#13;&#10;agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than&#13;&#10;in Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.&#13;&#10;Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to&#13;&#10;suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was&#13;&#10;ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very&#13;&#10;sincerely wish him happy.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the&#13;&#10;circumstances, she thus went on: “I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that&#13;&#10;I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure&#13;&#10;and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and&#13;&#10;wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial&#13;&#10;towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find&#13;&#10;out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to&#13;&#10;think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My&#13;&#10;watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more&#13;&#10;interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love&#13;&#10;with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.&#13;&#10;Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take&#13;&#10;his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the&#13;&#10;ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that&#13;&#10;handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 27&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise&#13;&#10;diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and&#13;&#10;sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take&#13;&#10;Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of&#13;&#10;going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan&#13;&#10;and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure&#13;&#10;as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing&#13;&#10;Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There&#13;&#10;was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such&#13;&#10;uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change&#13;&#10;was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her&#13;&#10;a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have&#13;&#10;been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,&#13;&#10;and was finally settled according to Charlotte’s first sketch. She was&#13;&#10;to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement&#13;&#10;of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became&#13;&#10;perfect as plan could be.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,&#13;&#10;and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he&#13;&#10;told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on&#13;&#10;his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that&#13;&#10;Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the&#13;&#10;first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner&#13;&#10;of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of&#13;&#10;what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their&#13;&#10;opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there&#13;&#10;was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to&#13;&#10;him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that,&#13;&#10;whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable&#13;&#10;and pleasing.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her&#13;&#10;think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a&#13;&#10;good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say&#13;&#10;that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much&#13;&#10;delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but&#13;&#10;she had known Sir William’s too long. He could tell her nothing new of&#13;&#10;the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were&#13;&#10;worn out, like his information.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early&#13;&#10;as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner’s&#13;&#10;door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when&#13;&#10;they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,&#13;&#10;looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and&#13;&#10;lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,&#13;&#10;whose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance would not allow them to&#13;&#10;wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen&#13;&#10;her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and&#13;&#10;kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and&#13;&#10;shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was her&#13;&#10;sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to&#13;&#10;her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her&#13;&#10;spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however,&#13;&#10;to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the&#13;&#10;particulars also of Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, and&#13;&#10;repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and&#13;&#10;herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the&#13;&#10;acquaintance.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham’s desertion, and&#13;&#10;complimented her on bearing it so well.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But my dear Elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is Miss King? I&#13;&#10;should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,&#13;&#10;between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,&#13;&#10;and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,&#13;&#10;because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get&#13;&#10;a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is&#13;&#10;mercenary.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know&#13;&#10;what to think.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather’s death&#13;&#10;made her mistress of this fortune.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No--why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_&#13;&#10;affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for&#13;&#10;making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally&#13;&#10;poor?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her&#13;&#10;so soon after this event.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant&#13;&#10;decorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,&#13;&#10;why should _we_?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her being&#13;&#10;deficient in something herself--sense or feeling.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose. _He_ shall be&#13;&#10;mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,&#13;&#10;to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in&#13;&#10;Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not&#13;&#10;much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow&#13;&#10;where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has&#13;&#10;neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones&#13;&#10;worth knowing, after all.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the&#13;&#10;unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in&#13;&#10;a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“We have not determined how far it shall carry us,” said Mrs. Gardiner,&#13;&#10;“but, perhaps, to the Lakes.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her&#13;&#10;acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. “Oh, my dear,&#13;&#10;dear aunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what felicity! You&#13;&#10;give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What&#13;&#10;are young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport&#13;&#10;we shall spend! And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other&#13;&#10;travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We&#13;&#10;_will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.&#13;&#10;Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our&#13;&#10;imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene,&#13;&#10;will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let _our_&#13;&#10;first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of&#13;&#10;travellers.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 28&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Every object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to&#13;&#10;Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had&#13;&#10;seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,&#13;&#10;and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in&#13;&#10;search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.&#13;&#10;The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth&#13;&#10;smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the&#13;&#10;road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,&#13;&#10;everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte&#13;&#10;appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which&#13;&#10;led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of&#13;&#10;the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing&#13;&#10;at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the&#13;&#10;liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with&#13;&#10;coming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw&#13;&#10;instantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage;&#13;&#10;his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some&#13;&#10;minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her&#13;&#10;family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the&#13;&#10;neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they&#13;&#10;were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious&#13;&#10;formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’s&#13;&#10;offers of refreshment.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help&#13;&#10;in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its&#13;&#10;aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her,&#13;&#10;as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But&#13;&#10;though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to&#13;&#10;gratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at&#13;&#10;her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.&#13;&#10;When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be&#13;&#10;ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her&#13;&#10;eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but&#13;&#10;in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to&#13;&#10;admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to&#13;&#10;the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had&#13;&#10;happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the&#13;&#10;garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of&#13;&#10;which he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most&#13;&#10;respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance&#13;&#10;with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and&#13;&#10;owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way&#13;&#10;through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an&#13;&#10;interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out&#13;&#10;with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the&#13;&#10;fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in&#13;&#10;the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which&#13;&#10;the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the&#13;&#10;prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered&#13;&#10;the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome&#13;&#10;modern building, well situated on rising ground.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;&#13;&#10;but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white&#13;&#10;frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte&#13;&#10;took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,&#13;&#10;probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’s&#13;&#10;help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything&#13;&#10;was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which&#13;&#10;Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be&#13;&#10;forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by&#13;&#10;Charlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often&#13;&#10;forgotten.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It&#13;&#10;was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining&#13;&#10;in, observed:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine&#13;&#10;de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will&#13;&#10;be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I&#13;&#10;doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice&#13;&#10;when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she&#13;&#10;will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she&#13;&#10;honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is&#13;&#10;charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed&#13;&#10;to walk home. Her ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I&#13;&#10;_should_ say, one of her ladyship’s carriages, for she has several.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,” added&#13;&#10;Charlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of&#13;&#10;woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,&#13;&#10;and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed,&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon&#13;&#10;Charlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,&#13;&#10;and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it&#13;&#10;was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit&#13;&#10;would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious&#13;&#10;interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with&#13;&#10;Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready&#13;&#10;for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in&#13;&#10;confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running&#13;&#10;up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened&#13;&#10;the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with&#13;&#10;agitation, cried out--&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for&#13;&#10;there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make&#13;&#10;haste, and come down this moment.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,&#13;&#10;and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in&#13;&#10;quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the&#13;&#10;garden gate.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And is this all?” cried Elizabeth. “I expected at least that the pigs&#13;&#10;were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her&#13;&#10;daughter.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“La! my dear,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not&#13;&#10;Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them;&#13;&#10;the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little&#13;&#10;creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.&#13;&#10;Why does she not come in?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours&#13;&#10;when Miss de Bourgh comes in.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I like her appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. “She&#13;&#10;looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will&#13;&#10;make him a very proper wife.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation&#13;&#10;with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth’s high diversion, was&#13;&#10;stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness&#13;&#10;before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that&#13;&#10;way.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and&#13;&#10;the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two&#13;&#10;girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which&#13;&#10;Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked&#13;&#10;to dine at Rosings the next day.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 29&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.&#13;&#10;The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering&#13;&#10;visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his&#13;&#10;wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity&#13;&#10;of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady&#13;&#10;Catherine’s condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised by&#13;&#10;her ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at&#13;&#10;Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it&#13;&#10;would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who&#13;&#10;could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there&#13;&#10;(an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately&#13;&#10;after your arrival!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William,&#13;&#10;“from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which&#13;&#10;my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such&#13;&#10;instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their&#13;&#10;visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what&#13;&#10;they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and&#13;&#10;so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth--&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady&#13;&#10;Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which&#13;&#10;becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on&#13;&#10;whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion&#13;&#10;for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you&#13;&#10;for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank&#13;&#10;preserved.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different&#13;&#10;doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much&#13;&#10;objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of&#13;&#10;her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas&#13;&#10;who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her&#13;&#10;introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done&#13;&#10;to his presentation at St. James’s.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a&#13;&#10;mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and&#13;&#10;Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such&#13;&#10;raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but&#13;&#10;slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the&#13;&#10;house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally&#13;&#10;cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every&#13;&#10;moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.&#13;&#10;Elizabeth’s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady&#13;&#10;Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or&#13;&#10;miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought&#13;&#10;she could witness without trepidation.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a&#13;&#10;rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they&#13;&#10;followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady&#13;&#10;Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship,&#13;&#10;with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had&#13;&#10;settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should&#13;&#10;be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those&#13;&#10;apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so completely&#13;&#10;awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage&#13;&#10;enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;&#13;&#10;and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge&#13;&#10;of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself&#13;&#10;quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her&#13;&#10;composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked&#13;&#10;features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not&#13;&#10;conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her&#13;&#10;visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by&#13;&#10;silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone,&#13;&#10;as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to&#13;&#10;Elizabeth’s mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she&#13;&#10;believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment&#13;&#10;she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the&#13;&#10;daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria’s astonishment at her&#13;&#10;being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any&#13;&#10;likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her&#13;&#10;features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very&#13;&#10;little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance&#13;&#10;there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening&#13;&#10;to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before&#13;&#10;her eyes.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to&#13;&#10;admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,&#13;&#10;and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth&#13;&#10;looking at in the summer.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and&#13;&#10;all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had&#13;&#10;likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her&#13;&#10;ladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish&#13;&#10;nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted&#13;&#10;alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir&#13;&#10;William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law&#13;&#10;said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.&#13;&#10;But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and&#13;&#10;gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved&#13;&#10;a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth&#13;&#10;was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated&#13;&#10;between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in&#13;&#10;listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all&#13;&#10;dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little&#13;&#10;Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing&#13;&#10;she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the&#13;&#10;gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to&#13;&#10;be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any&#13;&#10;intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every&#13;&#10;subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to&#13;&#10;have her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte’s domestic&#13;&#10;concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as&#13;&#10;to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be&#13;&#10;regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the&#13;&#10;care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was&#13;&#10;beneath this great lady’s attention, which could furnish her with an&#13;&#10;occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse&#13;&#10;with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew&#13;&#10;the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel,&#13;&#10;pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters&#13;&#10;she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of&#13;&#10;them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they&#13;&#10;had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been&#13;&#10;her mother’s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of&#13;&#10;her questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then&#13;&#10;observed,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your&#13;&#10;sake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no&#13;&#10;occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought&#13;&#10;necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family. Do you play and sing, Miss&#13;&#10;Bennet?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“A little.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our&#13;&#10;instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it&#13;&#10;some day. Do your sisters play and sing?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“One of them does.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss&#13;&#10;Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do&#13;&#10;you draw?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No, not at all.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“What, none of you?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Not one.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother&#13;&#10;should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Has your governess left you?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“We never had any governess.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home&#13;&#10;without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must&#13;&#10;have been quite a slave to your education.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been&#13;&#10;the case.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you&#13;&#10;must have been neglected.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as&#13;&#10;wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to&#13;&#10;read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be&#13;&#10;idle, certainly might.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had&#13;&#10;known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage&#13;&#10;one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady&#13;&#10;and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is&#13;&#10;wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that&#13;&#10;way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces&#13;&#10;of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and&#13;&#10;it was but the other day that I recommended another young person,&#13;&#10;who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite&#13;&#10;delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf’s&#13;&#10;calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. ‘Lady&#13;&#10;Catherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a treasure.’ Are any of your&#13;&#10;younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, ma’am, all.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The&#13;&#10;younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters&#13;&#10;must be very young?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be&#13;&#10;much in company. But really, ma’am, I think it would be very hard upon&#13;&#10;younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and&#13;&#10;amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to&#13;&#10;marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth&#13;&#10;as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would&#13;&#10;not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Upon my word,” said her ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly&#13;&#10;for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your&#13;&#10;ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;&#13;&#10;and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever&#13;&#10;dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not&#13;&#10;conceal your age.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am not one-and-twenty.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables&#13;&#10;were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat&#13;&#10;down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the&#13;&#10;two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her&#13;&#10;party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was&#13;&#10;uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson&#13;&#10;expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or&#13;&#10;having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the&#13;&#10;other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes&#13;&#10;of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins&#13;&#10;was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her&#13;&#10;for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.&#13;&#10;Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes&#13;&#10;and noble names.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,&#13;&#10;the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,&#13;&#10;gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered&#13;&#10;round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were&#13;&#10;to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by&#13;&#10;the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.&#13;&#10;Collins’s side and as many bows on Sir William’s they departed. As soon&#13;&#10;as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin&#13;&#10;to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for&#13;&#10;Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her&#13;&#10;commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy&#13;&#10;Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship’s praise&#13;&#10;into his own hands.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 30&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long&#13;&#10;enough to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled,&#13;&#10;and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not&#13;&#10;often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his&#13;&#10;morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but&#13;&#10;when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,&#13;&#10;and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her&#13;&#10;cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast&#13;&#10;and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in&#13;&#10;reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room,&#13;&#10;which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.&#13;&#10;Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer&#13;&#10;the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a&#13;&#10;more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent&#13;&#10;reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been&#13;&#10;much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and&#13;&#10;she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and&#13;&#10;were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went&#13;&#10;along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,&#13;&#10;which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened&#13;&#10;almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and&#13;&#10;had a few minutes’ conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever&#13;&#10;prevailed upon to get out.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and&#13;&#10;not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;&#13;&#10;and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings&#13;&#10;to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many&#13;&#10;hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,&#13;&#10;and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during&#13;&#10;these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,&#13;&#10;and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement&#13;&#10;of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she&#13;&#10;accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding&#13;&#10;out that Mrs. Collins’s joints of meat were too large for her family.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in&#13;&#10;commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate&#13;&#10;in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her&#13;&#10;by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to&#13;&#10;be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the&#13;&#10;village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold&#13;&#10;them into harmony and plenty.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;&#13;&#10;and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one&#13;&#10;card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart&#13;&#10;of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living&#13;&#10;in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins’s reach. This,&#13;&#10;however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time&#13;&#10;comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with&#13;&#10;Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had&#13;&#10;often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she&#13;&#10;frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was&#13;&#10;along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was&#13;&#10;a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and&#13;&#10;where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s curiosity.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.&#13;&#10;Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an&#13;&#10;addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be&#13;&#10;important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was&#13;&#10;expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not&#13;&#10;many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would&#13;&#10;furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and&#13;&#10;she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on him&#13;&#10;were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently&#13;&#10;destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest&#13;&#10;satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and&#13;&#10;seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by&#13;&#10;Miss Lucas and herself.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking&#13;&#10;the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,&#13;&#10;in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his&#13;&#10;bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great&#13;&#10;intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his&#13;&#10;respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for&#13;&#10;Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of&#13;&#10;his uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when&#13;&#10;Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen&#13;&#10;them from her husband’s room, crossing the road, and immediately running&#13;&#10;into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would&#13;&#10;never have come so soon to wait upon me.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,&#13;&#10;before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly&#13;&#10;afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,&#13;&#10;who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and&#13;&#10;address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been&#13;&#10;used to look in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual&#13;&#10;reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her&#13;&#10;friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely&#13;&#10;curtseyed to him without saying a word.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the&#13;&#10;readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but&#13;&#10;his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and&#13;&#10;garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.&#13;&#10;At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of&#13;&#10;Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual&#13;&#10;way, and after a moment’s pause, added:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never&#13;&#10;happened to see her there?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see&#13;&#10;whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between&#13;&#10;the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he&#13;&#10;answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The&#13;&#10;subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went&#13;&#10;away.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 31&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,&#13;&#10;and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures&#13;&#10;of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they&#13;&#10;received any invitation thither--for while there were visitors in the&#13;&#10;house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,&#13;&#10;almost a week after the gentlemen’s arrival, that they were honoured by&#13;&#10;such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to&#13;&#10;come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little&#13;&#10;of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the&#13;&#10;Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen&#13;&#10;only at church.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined&#13;&#10;the party in Lady Catherine’s drawing-room. Her ladyship received&#13;&#10;them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so&#13;&#10;acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,&#13;&#10;almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,&#13;&#10;much more than to any other person in the room.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a&#13;&#10;welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins’s pretty friend had&#13;&#10;moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and&#13;&#10;talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying&#13;&#10;at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so&#13;&#10;well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much&#13;&#10;spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself,&#13;&#10;as well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned&#13;&#10;towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a&#13;&#10;while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not&#13;&#10;scruple to call out:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking&#13;&#10;of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“We are speaking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able to avoid&#13;&#10;a reply.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I&#13;&#10;must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music.&#13;&#10;There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment&#13;&#10;of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt,&#13;&#10;I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health&#13;&#10;had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed&#13;&#10;delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s proficiency.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said Lady&#13;&#10;Catherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel&#13;&#10;if she does not practice a good deal.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I assure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need such advice.&#13;&#10;She practises very constantly.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write&#13;&#10;to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often&#13;&#10;tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without&#13;&#10;constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she&#13;&#10;will never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs.&#13;&#10;Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told&#13;&#10;her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.&#13;&#10;Jenkinson’s room. She would be in nobody’s way, you know, in that part&#13;&#10;of the house.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill-breeding, and made&#13;&#10;no answer.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having&#13;&#10;promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He&#13;&#10;drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then&#13;&#10;talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away&#13;&#10;from her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte&#13;&#10;stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer’s&#13;&#10;countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first&#13;&#10;convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear&#13;&#10;me? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well. There&#13;&#10;is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the&#13;&#10;will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate&#13;&#10;me.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I shall not say you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you could not&#13;&#10;really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have&#13;&#10;had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find&#13;&#10;great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are&#13;&#10;not your own.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to&#13;&#10;Colonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of&#13;&#10;me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky&#13;&#10;in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part&#13;&#10;of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of&#13;&#10;credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all&#13;&#10;that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to&#13;&#10;say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such&#13;&#10;things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried Colonel&#13;&#10;Fitzwilliam. “I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.&#13;&#10;The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,&#13;&#10;was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced&#13;&#10;only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain&#13;&#10;knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a&#13;&#10;partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly&#13;&#10;beyond my own party.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel&#13;&#10;Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better, had I sought an&#13;&#10;introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth, still&#13;&#10;addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. “Shall we ask him why a man of sense and&#13;&#10;education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend&#13;&#10;himself to strangers?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying to&#13;&#10;him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said Darcy,&#13;&#10;“of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot&#13;&#10;catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their&#13;&#10;concerns, as I often see done.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the&#13;&#10;masterly manner which I see so many women’s do. They have not the same&#13;&#10;force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I&#13;&#10;have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I will not take the&#13;&#10;trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as&#13;&#10;capable as any other woman’s of superior execution.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Darcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right. You have employed your&#13;&#10;time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can&#13;&#10;think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know&#13;&#10;what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.&#13;&#10;Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said&#13;&#10;to Darcy:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and&#13;&#10;could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion&#13;&#10;of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne’s. Anne would have&#13;&#10;been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his&#13;&#10;cousin’s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she&#13;&#10;discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss&#13;&#10;de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have&#13;&#10;been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth’s performance, mixing&#13;&#10;with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received&#13;&#10;them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the&#13;&#10;gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship’s carriage was&#13;&#10;ready to take them all home.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 32&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane&#13;&#10;while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,&#13;&#10;when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a&#13;&#10;visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to&#13;&#10;be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her&#13;&#10;half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,&#13;&#10;when the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and&#13;&#10;Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his&#13;&#10;intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were&#13;&#10;to be within.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,&#13;&#10;seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely&#13;&#10;necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence&#13;&#10;recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and&#13;&#10;feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty&#13;&#10;departure, she observed:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!&#13;&#10;It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you&#13;&#10;all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day&#13;&#10;before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Perfectly so, I thank you.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short&#13;&#10;pause added:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever&#13;&#10;returning to Netherfield again?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend&#13;&#10;very little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, and&#13;&#10;is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually&#13;&#10;increasing.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for&#13;&#10;the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we&#13;&#10;might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did&#13;&#10;not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as&#13;&#10;for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same&#13;&#10;principle.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it up as&#13;&#10;soon as any eligible purchase offers.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his&#13;&#10;friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the&#13;&#10;trouble of finding a subject to him.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He took the hint, and soon began with, “This seems a very comfortable&#13;&#10;house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.&#13;&#10;Collins first came to Hunsford.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her&#13;&#10;kindness on a more grateful object.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one&#13;&#10;of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made&#13;&#10;him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though&#13;&#10;I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the&#13;&#10;wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a&#13;&#10;prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a&#13;&#10;distance of her own family and friends.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day’s&#13;&#10;journey. Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_&#13;&#10;of the match,” cried Elizabeth. “I should never have said Mrs. Collins&#13;&#10;was settled _near_ her family.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond&#13;&#10;the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she&#13;&#10;understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and&#13;&#10;Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her&#13;&#10;family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many&#13;&#10;varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of&#13;&#10;travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the&#13;&#10;case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not&#13;&#10;such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my&#13;&#10;friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_&#13;&#10;the present distance.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “_You_ cannot&#13;&#10;have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have&#13;&#10;been always at Longbourn.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of&#13;&#10;feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and&#13;&#10;glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Are you pleased with Kent?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side&#13;&#10;calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte&#13;&#10;and her sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised&#13;&#10;them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding&#13;&#10;on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying&#13;&#10;much to anybody, went away.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he was&#13;&#10;gone. “My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never&#13;&#10;have called us in this familiar way.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,&#13;&#10;even to Charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and after various&#13;&#10;conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from&#13;&#10;the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable&#13;&#10;from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there&#13;&#10;was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot&#13;&#10;always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the&#13;&#10;pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the&#13;&#10;two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither&#13;&#10;almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes&#13;&#10;separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their&#13;&#10;aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he&#13;&#10;had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended&#13;&#10;him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in&#13;&#10;being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her&#13;&#10;former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw&#13;&#10;there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners,&#13;&#10;she believed he might have the best informed mind.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult&#13;&#10;to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there&#13;&#10;ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak,&#13;&#10;it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice&#13;&#10;to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really&#13;&#10;animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel&#13;&#10;Fitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was&#13;&#10;generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told&#13;&#10;her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect&#13;&#10;of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself&#13;&#10;seriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at&#13;&#10;Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He&#13;&#10;certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that&#13;&#10;look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often&#13;&#10;doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it&#13;&#10;seemed nothing but absence of mind.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his&#13;&#10;being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.&#13;&#10;Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of&#13;&#10;raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her&#13;&#10;opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend’s dislike would&#13;&#10;vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying&#13;&#10;Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he&#13;&#10;certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,&#13;&#10;to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage&#13;&#10;in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 33&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,&#13;&#10;unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the&#13;&#10;mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to&#13;&#10;prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that&#13;&#10;it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,&#13;&#10;therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like&#13;&#10;wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was&#13;&#10;not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,&#13;&#10;but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He&#13;&#10;never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking&#13;&#10;or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third&#13;&#10;rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about&#13;&#10;her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her&#13;&#10;opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s happiness; and that in speaking of&#13;&#10;Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to&#13;&#10;expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying&#13;&#10;_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel&#13;&#10;Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must&#13;&#10;mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed&#13;&#10;her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the&#13;&#10;pales opposite the Parsonage.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane’s last letter,&#13;&#10;and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in&#13;&#10;spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw&#13;&#10;on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the&#13;&#10;letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I generally&#13;&#10;do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are&#13;&#10;you going much farther?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No, I should have turned in a moment.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage&#13;&#10;together.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He&#13;&#10;arranges the business just as he pleases.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least&#13;&#10;pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems&#13;&#10;more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.&#13;&#10;“But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it&#13;&#10;than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak&#13;&#10;feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and&#13;&#10;dependence.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of&#13;&#10;either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and&#13;&#10;dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going&#13;&#10;wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have&#13;&#10;experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater&#13;&#10;weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where&#13;&#10;they like.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often&#13;&#10;do.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many&#13;&#10;in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to&#13;&#10;money.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the&#13;&#10;idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray, what&#13;&#10;is the usual price of an earl’s younger son? Unless the elder brother is&#13;&#10;very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt&#13;&#10;a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,&#13;&#10;she soon afterwards said:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of&#13;&#10;having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a&#13;&#10;lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well&#13;&#10;for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he&#13;&#10;likes with her.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he must&#13;&#10;divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your&#13;&#10;charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a&#13;&#10;little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she&#13;&#10;may like to have her own way.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner&#13;&#10;in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to&#13;&#10;give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other&#13;&#10;got pretty near the truth. She directly replied:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare&#13;&#10;say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a&#13;&#10;very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and&#13;&#10;Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man--he&#13;&#10;is a great friend of Darcy’s.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! yes,” said Elizabeth drily; “Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.&#13;&#10;Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in&#13;&#10;those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in&#13;&#10;our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to&#13;&#10;him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that&#13;&#10;Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“What is it you mean?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known,&#13;&#10;because if it were to get round to the lady’s family, it would be an&#13;&#10;unpleasant thing.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be&#13;&#10;Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself&#13;&#10;on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most&#13;&#10;imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other&#13;&#10;particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing&#13;&#10;him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from&#13;&#10;knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I understood that there were some very strong objections against the&#13;&#10;lady.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And what arts did he use to separate them?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling. “He&#13;&#10;only told me what I have now told you.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with&#13;&#10;indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she&#13;&#10;was so thoughtful.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “Your&#13;&#10;cousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his&#13;&#10;friend’s inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to&#13;&#10;determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy.&#13;&#10;But,” she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the&#13;&#10;particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed&#13;&#10;that there was much affection in the case.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam, “but it is a&#13;&#10;lessening of the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture&#13;&#10;of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and&#13;&#10;therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent&#13;&#10;matters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,&#13;&#10;as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption&#13;&#10;of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other&#13;&#10;people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There&#13;&#10;could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have&#13;&#10;such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures&#13;&#10;taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had&#13;&#10;always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement&#13;&#10;of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was&#13;&#10;the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had&#13;&#10;suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while&#13;&#10;every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the&#13;&#10;world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were Colonel&#13;&#10;Fitzwilliam’s words; and those strong objections probably were, her&#13;&#10;having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in&#13;&#10;business in London.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of&#13;&#10;objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!--her understanding&#13;&#10;excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither&#13;&#10;could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some&#13;&#10;peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and&#13;&#10;respectability which he will probably never reach.” When she thought of&#13;&#10;her mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow&#13;&#10;that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose&#13;&#10;pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of&#13;&#10;importance in his friend’s connections, than from their want of sense;&#13;&#10;and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed&#13;&#10;by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr.&#13;&#10;Bingley for his sister.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a&#13;&#10;headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to&#13;&#10;her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her&#13;&#10;cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,&#13;&#10;seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much&#13;&#10;as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins&#13;&#10;could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine’s being rather&#13;&#10;displeased by her staying at home.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 34&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself&#13;&#10;as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the&#13;&#10;examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her&#13;&#10;being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any&#13;&#10;revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.&#13;&#10;But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that&#13;&#10;cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which,&#13;&#10;proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly&#13;&#10;disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth&#13;&#10;noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an&#13;&#10;attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy’s&#13;&#10;shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her&#13;&#10;a keener sense of her sister’s sufferings. It was some consolation&#13;&#10;to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the&#13;&#10;next--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should&#13;&#10;herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of&#13;&#10;her spirits, by all that affection could do.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She could not think of Darcy’s leaving Kent without remembering that&#13;&#10;his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear&#13;&#10;that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not&#13;&#10;mean to be unhappy about him.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the&#13;&#10;door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its&#13;&#10;being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in&#13;&#10;the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.&#13;&#10;But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently&#13;&#10;affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the&#13;&#10;room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her&#13;&#10;health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.&#13;&#10;She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and&#13;&#10;then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but&#13;&#10;said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her&#13;&#10;in an agitated manner, and thus began:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be&#13;&#10;repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love&#13;&#10;you.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,&#13;&#10;doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement;&#13;&#10;and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her,&#13;&#10;immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides&#13;&#10;those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the&#13;&#10;subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of&#13;&#10;its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which had always&#13;&#10;opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to&#13;&#10;the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his&#13;&#10;suit.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to&#13;&#10;the compliment of such a man’s affection, and though her intentions did&#13;&#10;not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to&#13;&#10;receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she&#13;&#10;lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to&#13;&#10;answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with&#13;&#10;representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite&#13;&#10;of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with&#13;&#10;expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of&#13;&#10;his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt&#13;&#10;of a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but&#13;&#10;his countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could&#13;&#10;only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her&#13;&#10;cheeks, and she said:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to&#13;&#10;express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however&#13;&#10;unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should&#13;&#10;be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I&#13;&#10;cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly&#13;&#10;bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to&#13;&#10;anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be&#13;&#10;of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented&#13;&#10;the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in&#13;&#10;overcoming it after this explanation.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed&#13;&#10;on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than&#13;&#10;surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance&#13;&#10;of his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the&#13;&#10;appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed&#13;&#10;himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth’s feelings&#13;&#10;dreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!&#13;&#10;I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at&#13;&#10;civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why with so evident a desire&#13;&#10;of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me&#13;&#10;against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?&#13;&#10;Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have&#13;&#10;other provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against&#13;&#10;you--had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you&#13;&#10;think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has&#13;&#10;been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most&#13;&#10;beloved sister?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion&#13;&#10;was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she&#13;&#10;continued:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can&#13;&#10;excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,&#13;&#10;you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means&#13;&#10;of dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of the&#13;&#10;world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for&#13;&#10;disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest&#13;&#10;kind.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening&#13;&#10;with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.&#13;&#10;He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With assumed tranquillity he then replied: “I have no wish of denying&#13;&#10;that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your&#13;&#10;sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been&#13;&#10;kinder than towards myself.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,&#13;&#10;but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike&#13;&#10;is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was&#13;&#10;decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received&#13;&#10;many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to&#13;&#10;say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?&#13;&#10;or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said Darcy,&#13;&#10;in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an&#13;&#10;interest in him?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy contemptuously; “yes, his misfortunes&#13;&#10;have been great indeed.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth with energy. “You have reduced&#13;&#10;him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You have&#13;&#10;withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for&#13;&#10;him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence&#13;&#10;which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this!&#13;&#10;and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and&#13;&#10;ridicule.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,&#13;&#10;“is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me!&#13;&#10;I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this&#13;&#10;calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,” added he, stopping in&#13;&#10;his walk, and turning towards her, “these offenses might have been&#13;&#10;overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the&#13;&#10;scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These&#13;&#10;bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater&#13;&#10;policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of&#13;&#10;my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by&#13;&#10;reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.&#13;&#10;Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and&#13;&#10;just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your&#13;&#10;connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose&#13;&#10;condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to&#13;&#10;the utmost to speak with composure when she said:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your&#13;&#10;declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern&#13;&#10;which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more&#13;&#10;gentlemanlike manner.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that&#13;&#10;would have tempted me to accept it.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an&#13;&#10;expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“From the very beginning--from the first moment, I may almost say--of&#13;&#10;my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest&#13;&#10;belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of&#13;&#10;the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of&#13;&#10;disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a&#13;&#10;dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the&#13;&#10;last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your&#13;&#10;feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.&#13;&#10;Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best&#13;&#10;wishes for your health and happiness.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him&#13;&#10;the next moment open the front door and quit the house.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how&#13;&#10;to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for&#13;&#10;half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed,&#13;&#10;was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of&#13;&#10;marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for&#13;&#10;so many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of&#13;&#10;all the objections which had made him prevent his friend’s marrying&#13;&#10;her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his&#13;&#10;own case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired&#13;&#10;unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable&#13;&#10;pride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to&#13;&#10;Jane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could&#13;&#10;not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.&#13;&#10;Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon&#13;&#10;overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for&#13;&#10;a moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the&#13;&#10;sound of Lady Catherine’s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to&#13;&#10;encounter Charlotte’s observation, and hurried her away to her room.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 35&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations&#13;&#10;which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the&#13;&#10;surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything&#13;&#10;else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after&#13;&#10;breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding&#13;&#10;directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’s&#13;&#10;sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,&#13;&#10;she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The&#13;&#10;park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one&#13;&#10;of the gates into the ground.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was&#13;&#10;tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and&#13;&#10;look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had&#13;&#10;made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the&#13;&#10;verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,&#13;&#10;when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which&#13;&#10;edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr.&#13;&#10;Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now&#13;&#10;near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced&#13;&#10;her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though&#13;&#10;in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the&#13;&#10;gate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter,&#13;&#10;which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure,&#13;&#10;“I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.&#13;&#10;Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” And then, with a&#13;&#10;slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,&#13;&#10;Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,&#13;&#10;perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written&#13;&#10;quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise&#13;&#10;full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated&#13;&#10;from Rosings, at eight o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:--&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension&#13;&#10;of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those&#13;&#10;offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any&#13;&#10;intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes&#13;&#10;which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the&#13;&#10;effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,&#13;&#10;should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written&#13;&#10;and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand&#13;&#10;your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I&#13;&#10;demand it of your justice.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal&#13;&#10;magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,&#13;&#10;that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley&#13;&#10;from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various&#13;&#10;claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate&#13;&#10;prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and&#13;&#10;wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged&#13;&#10;favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other&#13;&#10;dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect&#13;&#10;its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young&#13;&#10;persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could&#13;&#10;bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last&#13;&#10;night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope&#13;&#10;to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions&#13;&#10;and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which&#13;&#10;is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which&#13;&#10;may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity&#13;&#10;must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with&#13;&#10;others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young&#13;&#10;woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance&#13;&#10;at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious&#13;&#10;attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I&#13;&#10;had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir&#13;&#10;William Lucas’s accidental information, that Bingley’s attentions to&#13;&#10;your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.&#13;&#10;He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could&#13;&#10;be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend’s behaviour&#13;&#10;attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss&#13;&#10;Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also&#13;&#10;watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever,&#13;&#10;but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced&#13;&#10;from the evening’s scrutiny, that though she received his attentions&#13;&#10;with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of&#13;&#10;sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been&#13;&#10;in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter&#13;&#10;probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict&#13;&#10;pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not&#13;&#10;scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister’s countenance and&#13;&#10;air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction&#13;&#10;that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be&#13;&#10;easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is&#13;&#10;certain--but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions&#13;&#10;are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe&#13;&#10;her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial&#13;&#10;conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the&#13;&#10;marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have&#13;&#10;the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of&#13;&#10;connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But&#13;&#10;there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still&#13;&#10;existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had&#13;&#10;myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before&#13;&#10;me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your&#13;&#10;mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that&#13;&#10;total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by&#13;&#10;herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your&#13;&#10;father. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern&#13;&#10;for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this&#13;&#10;representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to&#13;&#10;have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure,&#13;&#10;is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than&#13;&#10;it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say&#13;&#10;farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties&#13;&#10;was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led&#13;&#10;me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy&#13;&#10;connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as&#13;&#10;you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters’ uneasiness&#13;&#10;had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was&#13;&#10;soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in&#13;&#10;detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in&#13;&#10;London. We accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office&#13;&#10;of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I&#13;&#10;described, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance&#13;&#10;might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose&#13;&#10;that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been&#13;&#10;seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your&#13;&#10;sister’s indifference. He had before believed her to return his&#13;&#10;affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great&#13;&#10;natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his&#13;&#10;own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was&#13;&#10;no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into&#13;&#10;Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the&#13;&#10;work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There&#13;&#10;is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not&#13;&#10;reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the&#13;&#10;measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister’s being in&#13;&#10;town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her&#13;&#10;brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without&#13;&#10;ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me&#13;&#10;enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this&#13;&#10;concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it&#13;&#10;was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no&#13;&#10;other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister’s feelings, it&#13;&#10;was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to&#13;&#10;you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn&#13;&#10;them.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured&#13;&#10;Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his&#13;&#10;connection with my family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I&#13;&#10;am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more&#13;&#10;than one witness of undoubted veracity.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many&#13;&#10;years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good&#13;&#10;conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to&#13;&#10;be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his&#13;&#10;kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at&#13;&#10;school, and afterwards at Cambridge--most important assistance, as his&#13;&#10;own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have&#13;&#10;been unable to give him a gentleman’s education. My father was not only&#13;&#10;fond of this young man’s society, whose manners were always engaging; he&#13;&#10;had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be&#13;&#10;his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is&#13;&#10;many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different&#13;&#10;manner. The vicious propensities--the want of principle, which he was&#13;&#10;careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape&#13;&#10;the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself,&#13;&#10;and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.&#13;&#10;Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree&#13;&#10;you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham&#13;&#10;has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from&#13;&#10;unfolding his real character--it adds even another motive.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to&#13;&#10;Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly&#13;&#10;recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner&#13;&#10;that his profession might allow--and if he took orders, desired that a&#13;&#10;valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There&#13;&#10;was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long&#13;&#10;survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham&#13;&#10;wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders,&#13;&#10;he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more&#13;&#10;immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he&#13;&#10;could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying&#13;&#10;law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would&#13;&#10;be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed&#13;&#10;him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to&#13;&#10;his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the&#13;&#10;business was therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistance&#13;&#10;in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to&#13;&#10;receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection&#13;&#10;between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him&#13;&#10;to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly&#13;&#10;lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free&#13;&#10;from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.&#13;&#10;For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the&#13;&#10;incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to&#13;&#10;me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured&#13;&#10;me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He&#13;&#10;had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely&#13;&#10;resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in&#13;&#10;question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was&#13;&#10;well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not&#13;&#10;have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You will hardly blame&#13;&#10;me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every&#13;&#10;repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of&#13;&#10;his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me&#13;&#10;to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every&#13;&#10;appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But&#13;&#10;last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself,&#13;&#10;and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold&#13;&#10;to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your&#13;&#10;secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to&#13;&#10;the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.&#13;&#10;About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed&#13;&#10;for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided&#13;&#10;over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by&#13;&#10;design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him&#13;&#10;and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and&#13;&#10;by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,&#13;&#10;whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to&#13;&#10;her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and&#13;&#10;to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her&#13;&#10;excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed&#13;&#10;the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two&#13;&#10;before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the&#13;&#10;idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as&#13;&#10;a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and&#13;&#10;how I acted. Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented&#13;&#10;any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place&#13;&#10;immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr.&#13;&#10;Wickham’s chief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which&#13;&#10;is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of&#13;&#10;revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have&#13;&#10;been complete indeed.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have&#13;&#10;been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as&#13;&#10;false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr.&#13;&#10;Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he&#13;&#10;had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered&#13;&#10;at. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either,&#13;&#10;detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in&#13;&#10;your inclination.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but&#13;&#10;I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to&#13;&#10;be revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more&#13;&#10;particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our&#13;&#10;near relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of&#13;&#10;the executors of my father’s will, has been unavoidably acquainted&#13;&#10;with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of _me_&#13;&#10;should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by&#13;&#10;the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be&#13;&#10;the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some&#13;&#10;opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the&#13;&#10;morning. I will only add, God bless you.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“FITZWILLIAM DARCY”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 36&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to&#13;&#10;contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of&#13;&#10;its contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly&#13;&#10;she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.&#13;&#10;Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did&#13;&#10;she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;&#13;&#10;and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation&#13;&#10;to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong&#13;&#10;prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what&#13;&#10;had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly&#13;&#10;left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the&#13;&#10;next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of&#13;&#10;the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister’s insensibility she&#13;&#10;instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst&#13;&#10;objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing&#13;&#10;him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied&#13;&#10;her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and&#13;&#10;insolence.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when&#13;&#10;she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which,&#13;&#10;if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which&#13;&#10;bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her&#13;&#10;feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.&#13;&#10;Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished&#13;&#10;to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false!&#13;&#10;This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!”--and when she had&#13;&#10;gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the&#13;&#10;last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not&#13;&#10;regard it, that she would never look in it again.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on&#13;&#10;nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter&#13;&#10;was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she&#13;&#10;again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and&#13;&#10;commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.&#13;&#10;The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what&#13;&#10;he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though&#13;&#10;she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own&#13;&#10;words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the&#13;&#10;will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living&#13;&#10;was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was&#13;&#10;impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the&#13;&#10;other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did&#13;&#10;not err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the&#13;&#10;particulars immediately following of Wickham’s resigning all pretensions&#13;&#10;to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three&#13;&#10;thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down&#13;&#10;the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be&#13;&#10;impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with&#13;&#10;little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read&#13;&#10;on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had&#13;&#10;believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to&#13;&#10;render Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a&#13;&#10;turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at&#13;&#10;Mr. Wickham’s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could&#13;&#10;bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his&#13;&#10;entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the&#13;&#10;persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town,&#13;&#10;had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life&#13;&#10;nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As&#13;&#10;to his real character, had information been in her power, she had&#13;&#10;never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had&#13;&#10;established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried&#13;&#10;to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of&#13;&#10;integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of&#13;&#10;Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those&#13;&#10;casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy&#13;&#10;had described as the idleness and vice of many years’ continuance. But&#13;&#10;no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before&#13;&#10;her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more&#13;&#10;substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and&#13;&#10;the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After&#13;&#10;pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to&#13;&#10;read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss&#13;&#10;Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel&#13;&#10;Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was&#13;&#10;referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam&#13;&#10;himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his&#13;&#10;near concern in all his cousin’s affairs, and whose character she had no&#13;&#10;reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to&#13;&#10;him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and&#13;&#10;at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never&#13;&#10;have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his&#13;&#10;cousin’s corroboration.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation&#13;&#10;between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips’s.&#13;&#10;Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_&#13;&#10;struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and&#13;&#10;wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting&#13;&#10;himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions&#13;&#10;with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear&#13;&#10;of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that&#13;&#10;_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball&#13;&#10;the very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield&#13;&#10;family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but&#13;&#10;herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed;&#13;&#10;that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy’s&#13;&#10;character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would&#13;&#10;always prevent his exposing the son.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!&#13;&#10;His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and&#13;&#10;hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer&#13;&#10;the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.&#13;&#10;His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had&#13;&#10;either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying&#13;&#10;his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most&#13;&#10;incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter&#13;&#10;and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not&#13;&#10;but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago&#13;&#10;asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as&#13;&#10;were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their&#13;&#10;acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much&#13;&#10;together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything&#13;&#10;that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him&#13;&#10;of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was&#13;&#10;esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a&#13;&#10;brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his&#13;&#10;sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling; that had his&#13;&#10;actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of&#13;&#10;everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and&#13;&#10;that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man&#13;&#10;as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham&#13;&#10;could she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced,&#13;&#10;absurd.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“How despicably I have acted!” she cried; “I, who have prided myself&#13;&#10;on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have&#13;&#10;often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified&#13;&#10;my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this&#13;&#10;discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could&#13;&#10;not have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my&#13;&#10;folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect&#13;&#10;of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted&#13;&#10;prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were&#13;&#10;concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line&#13;&#10;which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy’s explanation&#13;&#10;_there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely&#13;&#10;different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that&#13;&#10;credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to&#13;&#10;give in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her&#13;&#10;sister’s attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte’s&#13;&#10;opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his&#13;&#10;description of Jane. She felt that Jane’s feelings, though fervent, were&#13;&#10;little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air&#13;&#10;and manner not often united with great sensibility.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were&#13;&#10;mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense&#13;&#10;of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly&#13;&#10;for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as&#13;&#10;having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first&#13;&#10;disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind&#13;&#10;than on hers.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed,&#13;&#10;but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been&#13;&#10;self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered&#13;&#10;that Jane’s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest&#13;&#10;relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt&#13;&#10;by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she&#13;&#10;had ever known before.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every&#13;&#10;variety of thought--re-considering events, determining probabilities,&#13;&#10;and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and&#13;&#10;so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made&#13;&#10;her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish&#13;&#10;of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such&#13;&#10;reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each&#13;&#10;called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take&#13;&#10;leave--but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least&#13;&#10;an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her&#13;&#10;till she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern&#13;&#10;in missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no&#13;&#10;longer an object; she could think only of her letter.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 37&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having&#13;&#10;been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was&#13;&#10;able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very&#13;&#10;good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the&#13;&#10;melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then&#13;&#10;hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return&#13;&#10;brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,&#13;&#10;importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of&#13;&#10;having them all to dine with her.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had&#13;&#10;she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as&#13;&#10;her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her&#13;&#10;ladyship’s indignation would have been. “What would she have said? how&#13;&#10;would she have behaved?” were questions with which she amused herself.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. “I assure&#13;&#10;you, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I believe no one&#13;&#10;feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly&#13;&#10;attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to&#13;&#10;me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The&#13;&#10;dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy&#13;&#10;seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. His&#13;&#10;attachment to Rosings certainly increases.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which&#13;&#10;were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of&#13;&#10;spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that&#13;&#10;she did not like to go home again so soon, she added:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that&#13;&#10;you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your&#13;&#10;company, I am sure.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,” replied&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, “but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town&#13;&#10;next Saturday.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected&#13;&#10;you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There&#13;&#10;can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly&#13;&#10;spare you for another fortnight.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters&#13;&#10;are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay&#13;&#10;another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as&#13;&#10;far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as&#13;&#10;Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room&#13;&#10;for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I&#13;&#10;should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our&#13;&#10;original plan.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lady Catherine seemed resigned. “Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant&#13;&#10;with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea&#13;&#10;of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.&#13;&#10;You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in&#13;&#10;the world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly&#13;&#10;guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my&#13;&#10;niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her&#13;&#10;having two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of&#13;&#10;Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with&#13;&#10;propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those&#13;&#10;things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I&#13;&#10;am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be&#13;&#10;discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My uncle is to send a servant for us.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you&#13;&#10;have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses?&#13;&#10;Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be&#13;&#10;attended to.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,&#13;&#10;and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,&#13;&#10;which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so&#13;&#10;occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be&#13;&#10;reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it&#13;&#10;as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary&#13;&#10;walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant&#13;&#10;recollections.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Darcy’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She&#13;&#10;studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at&#13;&#10;times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,&#13;&#10;she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly&#13;&#10;she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against&#13;&#10;herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.&#13;&#10;His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she&#13;&#10;could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal,&#13;&#10;or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past&#13;&#10;behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in&#13;&#10;the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.&#13;&#10;They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at&#13;&#10;them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his&#13;&#10;youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right&#13;&#10;herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently&#13;&#10;united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine&#13;&#10;and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence,&#13;&#10;what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,&#13;&#10;irritable, and completely under Lydia’s guidance, had been always&#13;&#10;affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would&#13;&#10;scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While&#13;&#10;there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while&#13;&#10;Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there&#13;&#10;forever.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Anxiety on Jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy’s&#13;&#10;explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,&#13;&#10;heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved&#13;&#10;to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any&#13;&#10;could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How&#13;&#10;grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every&#13;&#10;respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had&#13;&#10;been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham’s&#13;&#10;character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had&#13;&#10;seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it&#13;&#10;almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of&#13;&#10;her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent&#13;&#10;there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of&#13;&#10;their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,&#13;&#10;and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right&#13;&#10;way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the&#13;&#10;work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them&#13;&#10;a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;&#13;&#10;and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her&#13;&#10;hand to both.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 38&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few&#13;&#10;minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of&#13;&#10;paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether Mrs. Collins has yet&#13;&#10;expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very&#13;&#10;certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for&#13;&#10;it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We&#13;&#10;know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain&#13;&#10;manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we&#13;&#10;see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like&#13;&#10;yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,&#13;&#10;and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending&#13;&#10;your time unpleasantly.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She&#13;&#10;had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with&#13;&#10;Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_&#13;&#10;feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling&#13;&#10;solemnity replied:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not&#13;&#10;disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately&#13;&#10;having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and,&#13;&#10;from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the&#13;&#10;humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford&#13;&#10;visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to&#13;&#10;Lady Catherine’s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage&#13;&#10;and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You&#13;&#10;see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge&#13;&#10;that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should&#13;&#10;not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are&#13;&#10;sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was&#13;&#10;obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility&#13;&#10;and truth in a few short sentences.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into&#13;&#10;Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will&#13;&#10;be able to do so. Lady Catherine’s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you&#13;&#10;have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear&#13;&#10;that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be&#13;&#10;as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,&#13;&#10;that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in&#13;&#10;marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of&#13;&#10;thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of&#13;&#10;character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each&#13;&#10;other.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was&#13;&#10;the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed&#13;&#10;and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to&#13;&#10;have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang.&#13;&#10;Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she&#13;&#10;had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that&#13;&#10;her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her&#13;&#10;home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their&#13;&#10;dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels&#13;&#10;placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate&#13;&#10;parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by&#13;&#10;Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her&#13;&#10;with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks&#13;&#10;for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his&#13;&#10;compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her&#13;&#10;in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,&#13;&#10;when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had&#13;&#10;hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But,” he added, “you will of course wish to have your humble respects&#13;&#10;delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you&#13;&#10;while you have been here.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and&#13;&#10;the carriage drove off.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes’ silence, “it seems&#13;&#10;but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have&#13;&#10;happened!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“A great many indeed,” said her companion with a sigh.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!&#13;&#10;How much I shall have to tell!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth added privately, “And how much I shall have to conceal!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and&#13;&#10;within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner’s&#13;&#10;house, where they were to remain a few days.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her&#13;&#10;spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her&#13;&#10;aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at&#13;&#10;Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for&#13;&#10;Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy’s proposals. To know&#13;&#10;that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish&#13;&#10;Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own&#13;&#10;vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation&#13;&#10;to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision&#13;&#10;in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate;&#13;&#10;and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried&#13;&#10;into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister&#13;&#10;further.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 39&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out&#13;&#10;together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;&#13;&#10;and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet’s carriage&#13;&#10;was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman’s&#13;&#10;punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.&#13;&#10;These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed&#13;&#10;in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and&#13;&#10;dressing a salad and cucumber.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set&#13;&#10;out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,&#13;&#10;“Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia, “but you must lend us the&#13;&#10;money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” Then, showing&#13;&#10;her purchases--“Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think&#13;&#10;it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall&#13;&#10;pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any&#13;&#10;better.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect&#13;&#10;unconcern, “Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and&#13;&#10;when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I&#13;&#10;think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what&#13;&#10;one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they&#13;&#10;are going in a fortnight.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Are they indeed!” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to&#13;&#10;take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme;&#13;&#10;and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to&#13;&#10;go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall&#13;&#10;have!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes,” thought Elizabeth, “_that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed,&#13;&#10;and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole&#13;&#10;campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor&#13;&#10;regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Now I have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down at&#13;&#10;table. “What do you think? It is excellent news--capital news--and about&#13;&#10;a certain person we all like!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need&#13;&#10;not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the&#13;&#10;waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse&#13;&#10;things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad&#13;&#10;he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for&#13;&#10;my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?&#13;&#10;There is no danger of Wickham’s marrying Mary King. There’s for you! She&#13;&#10;is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And Mary King is safe!” added Elizabeth; “safe from a connection&#13;&#10;imprudent as to fortune.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said Jane.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never cared&#13;&#10;three straws about her--who could about such a nasty little freckled&#13;&#10;thing?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such&#13;&#10;coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_&#13;&#10;was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was&#13;&#10;ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their&#13;&#10;boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty’s and&#13;&#10;Lydia’s purchases, were seated in it.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“How nicely we are all crammed in,” cried Lydia. “I am glad I bought my&#13;&#10;bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now&#13;&#10;let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way&#13;&#10;home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all&#13;&#10;since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any&#13;&#10;flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband&#13;&#10;before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.&#13;&#10;She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not&#13;&#10;being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to&#13;&#10;get husbands, you can’t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.&#13;&#10;Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!&#13;&#10;how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would&#13;&#10;chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece&#13;&#10;of fun the other day at Colonel Forster’s. Kitty and me were to spend&#13;&#10;the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the&#13;&#10;evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so&#13;&#10;she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen&#13;&#10;was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We&#13;&#10;dressed up Chamberlayne in woman’s clothes on purpose to pass for a&#13;&#10;lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.&#13;&#10;Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow&#13;&#10;one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,&#13;&#10;and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they&#13;&#10;did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.&#13;&#10;Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect&#13;&#10;something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did&#13;&#10;Lydia, assisted by Kitty’s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her&#13;&#10;companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she&#13;&#10;could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham’s name.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane&#13;&#10;in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet&#13;&#10;say voluntarily to Elizabeth:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases&#13;&#10;came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that&#13;&#10;occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and&#13;&#10;poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one&#13;&#10;hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat&#13;&#10;some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger&#13;&#10;Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person’s,&#13;&#10;was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who&#13;&#10;would hear her.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!&#13;&#10;As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there&#13;&#10;was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty&#13;&#10;had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved&#13;&#10;very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold&#13;&#10;luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated&#13;&#10;you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never&#13;&#10;should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then&#13;&#10;we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that&#13;&#10;anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To this Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear sister,&#13;&#10;to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the&#13;&#10;generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for&#13;&#10;_me_--I should infinitely prefer a book.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to&#13;&#10;anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk&#13;&#10;to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily&#13;&#10;opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could&#13;&#10;not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.&#13;&#10;There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr.&#13;&#10;Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The&#13;&#10;comfort to _her_ of the regiment’s approaching removal was indeed beyond&#13;&#10;expression. In a fortnight they were to go--and once gone, she hoped&#13;&#10;there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton&#13;&#10;scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under&#13;&#10;frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her&#13;&#10;father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were&#13;&#10;at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often&#13;&#10;disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 40&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth’s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could&#13;&#10;no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every&#13;&#10;particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be&#13;&#10;surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene&#13;&#10;between Mr. Darcy and herself.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Miss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly&#13;&#10;partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly&#13;&#10;natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was&#13;&#10;sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so&#13;&#10;little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the&#13;&#10;unhappiness which her sister’s refusal must have given him.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly&#13;&#10;ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his&#13;&#10;disappointment!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has&#13;&#10;other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.&#13;&#10;You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Blame you! Oh, no.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very next&#13;&#10;day.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far&#13;&#10;as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane!&#13;&#10;who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that&#13;&#10;so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here&#13;&#10;collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy’s vindication, though&#13;&#10;grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.&#13;&#10;Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and&#13;&#10;seek to clear the one without involving the other.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both&#13;&#10;of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied&#13;&#10;with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just&#13;&#10;enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting&#13;&#10;about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy’s;&#13;&#10;but you shall do as you choose.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham so&#13;&#10;very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only&#13;&#10;consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the&#13;&#10;knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing&#13;&#10;of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it&#13;&#10;so.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so&#13;&#10;full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am&#13;&#10;growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion&#13;&#10;makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will&#13;&#10;be as light as a feather.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his&#13;&#10;countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those&#13;&#10;two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the&#13;&#10;appearance of it.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you&#13;&#10;used to do.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike&#13;&#10;to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one’s genius, such an&#13;&#10;opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually&#13;&#10;abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing&#13;&#10;at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat&#13;&#10;the matter as you do now.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And&#13;&#10;with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say&#13;&#10;that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I&#13;&#10;had! Oh! how I wanted you!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions&#13;&#10;in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly&#13;&#10;undeserved.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most&#13;&#10;natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There&#13;&#10;is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I&#13;&#10;ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand&#13;&#10;Wickham’s character.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can be no&#13;&#10;occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me&#13;&#10;to make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular&#13;&#10;relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to&#13;&#10;myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his&#13;&#10;conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy&#13;&#10;is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in&#13;&#10;Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal&#13;&#10;to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to&#13;&#10;anyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out,&#13;&#10;and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At&#13;&#10;present I will say nothing about it.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for&#13;&#10;ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to&#13;&#10;re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The tumult of Elizabeth’s mind was allayed by this conversation. She had&#13;&#10;got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,&#13;&#10;and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish&#13;&#10;to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind,&#13;&#10;of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other&#13;&#10;half of Mr. Darcy’s letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she&#13;&#10;had been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one&#13;&#10;could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect&#13;&#10;understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off&#13;&#10;this last encumbrance of mystery. “And then,” said she, “if that very&#13;&#10;improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to&#13;&#10;tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The&#13;&#10;liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real&#13;&#10;state of her sister’s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a&#13;&#10;very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself&#13;&#10;in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment,&#13;&#10;and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first&#13;&#10;attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance,&#13;&#10;and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her&#13;&#10;attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the&#13;&#10;indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own&#13;&#10;health and their tranquillity.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Well, Lizzy,” said Mrs. Bennet one day, “what is your opinion _now_ of&#13;&#10;this sad business of Jane’s? For my part, I am determined never to speak&#13;&#10;of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But&#13;&#10;I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is&#13;&#10;a very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there’s the least&#13;&#10;chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of&#13;&#10;his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of&#13;&#10;everybody, too, who is likely to know.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I&#13;&#10;shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I&#13;&#10;would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will&#13;&#10;die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,&#13;&#10;she made no answer.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Well, Lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the&#13;&#10;Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope&#13;&#10;it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an&#13;&#10;excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her&#13;&#10;mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_&#13;&#10;housekeeping, I dare say.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No, nothing at all.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes, _they_ will&#13;&#10;take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed&#13;&#10;for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often&#13;&#10;talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as&#13;&#10;quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It was a subject which they could not mention before me.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they&#13;&#10;often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an&#13;&#10;estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be&#13;&#10;ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 41&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was&#13;&#10;the last of the regiment’s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies&#13;&#10;in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost&#13;&#10;universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,&#13;&#10;and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very&#13;&#10;frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and&#13;&#10;Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such&#13;&#10;hard-heartedness in any of the family.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?” would they&#13;&#10;often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “How can you be smiling so,&#13;&#10;Lizzy?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what&#13;&#10;she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years&#13;&#10;ago.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am sure,” said she, “I cried for two days together when Colonel&#13;&#10;Miller’s regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am sure I shall break _mine_,” said Lydia.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so&#13;&#10;disagreeable.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,”&#13;&#10; added Kitty.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through&#13;&#10;Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense&#13;&#10;of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy’s&#13;&#10;objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his&#13;&#10;interference in the views of his friend.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But the gloom of Lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she&#13;&#10;received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of&#13;&#10;the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a&#13;&#10;very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour&#13;&#10;and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of&#13;&#10;their _three_ months’ acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,&#13;&#10;the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely&#13;&#10;to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister’s feelings, Lydia&#13;&#10;flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone’s&#13;&#10;congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;&#13;&#10;whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate&#13;&#10;in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,”&#13;&#10; said she, “Though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much&#13;&#10;right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make&#13;&#10;her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from&#13;&#10;exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she&#13;&#10;considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense&#13;&#10;for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it&#13;&#10;known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her&#13;&#10;go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia’s general&#13;&#10;behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of&#13;&#10;such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more&#13;&#10;imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must&#13;&#10;be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public&#13;&#10;place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so&#13;&#10;little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present&#13;&#10;circumstances.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“If you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the very great disadvantage to&#13;&#10;us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia’s unguarded and&#13;&#10;imprudent manner--nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you&#13;&#10;would judge differently in the affair.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Already arisen?” repeated Mr. Bennet. “What, has she frightened away&#13;&#10;some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such&#13;&#10;squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity&#13;&#10;are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who&#13;&#10;have been kept aloof by Lydia’s folly.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not&#13;&#10;of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our&#13;&#10;importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the&#13;&#10;wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark&#13;&#10;Lydia’s character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear&#13;&#10;father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and&#13;&#10;of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of&#13;&#10;her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character&#13;&#10;will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt&#13;&#10;that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the&#13;&#10;worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond&#13;&#10;youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness&#13;&#10;of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal&#13;&#10;contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger&#13;&#10;Kitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,&#13;&#10;ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you&#13;&#10;suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever&#13;&#10;they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the&#13;&#10;disgrace?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and&#13;&#10;affectionately taking her hand said in reply:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known&#13;&#10;you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less&#13;&#10;advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly&#13;&#10;sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to&#13;&#10;Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will&#13;&#10;keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an&#13;&#10;object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance&#13;&#10;even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find&#13;&#10;women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being&#13;&#10;there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow&#13;&#10;many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest&#13;&#10;of her life.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion&#13;&#10;continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not&#13;&#10;in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on&#13;&#10;them. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret&#13;&#10;over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her&#13;&#10;disposition.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her&#13;&#10;father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their&#13;&#10;united volubility. In Lydia’s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised&#13;&#10;every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye&#13;&#10;of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.&#13;&#10;She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them&#13;&#10;at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp--its tents&#13;&#10;stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young&#13;&#10;and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she&#13;&#10;saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six&#13;&#10;officers at once.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such&#13;&#10;realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have&#13;&#10;been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.&#13;&#10;Lydia’s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy&#13;&#10;conviction of her husband’s never intending to go there himself.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures&#13;&#10;continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia’s leaving&#13;&#10;home.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been&#13;&#10;frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty&#13;&#10;well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even&#13;&#10;learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted&#13;&#10;her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present&#13;&#10;behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,&#13;&#10;for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which&#13;&#10;had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after&#13;&#10;what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in&#13;&#10;finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous&#13;&#10;gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the&#13;&#10;reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever&#13;&#10;cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,&#13;&#10;and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;On the very last day of the regiment’s remaining at Meryton, he dined,&#13;&#10;with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth&#13;&#10;disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some&#13;&#10;inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she&#13;&#10;mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’s and Mr. Darcy’s having both spent three&#13;&#10;weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment’s&#13;&#10;recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen&#13;&#10;him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,&#13;&#10;asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.&#13;&#10;With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“How long did you say he was at Rosings?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Nearly three weeks.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And you saw him frequently?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, almost every day.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“His manners are very different from his cousin’s.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Indeed!” cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. “And&#13;&#10;pray, may I ask?--” But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “Is&#13;&#10;it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility&#13;&#10;to his ordinary style?--for I dare not hope,” he continued in a lower&#13;&#10;and more serious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, I believe, he is very much&#13;&#10;what he ever was.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to&#13;&#10;rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a&#13;&#10;something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive&#13;&#10;and anxious attention, while she added:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that&#13;&#10;his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from&#13;&#10;knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Wickham’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated&#13;&#10;look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his&#13;&#10;embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of&#13;&#10;accents:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily&#13;&#10;comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume&#13;&#10;even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,&#13;&#10;may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only&#13;&#10;deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only&#13;&#10;fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been&#13;&#10;alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good&#13;&#10;opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always&#13;&#10;operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be&#13;&#10;imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I&#13;&#10;am certain he has very much at heart.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a&#13;&#10;slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on&#13;&#10;the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge&#13;&#10;him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his&#13;&#10;side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish&#13;&#10;Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a&#13;&#10;mutual desire of never meeting again.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,&#13;&#10;from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation&#13;&#10;between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the&#13;&#10;only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.&#13;&#10;Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,&#13;&#10;and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the&#13;&#10;opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible--advice which&#13;&#10;there was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in&#13;&#10;the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more&#13;&#10;gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 42&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Had Elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could&#13;&#10;not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic&#13;&#10;comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance&#13;&#10;of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a&#13;&#10;woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in&#13;&#10;their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,&#13;&#10;esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views&#13;&#10;of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of&#13;&#10;a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own&#13;&#10;imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often&#13;&#10;console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of&#13;&#10;the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal&#13;&#10;enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as&#13;&#10;her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not&#13;&#10;the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his&#13;&#10;wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true&#13;&#10;philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her&#13;&#10;father’s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but&#13;&#10;respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of&#13;&#10;herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to&#13;&#10;banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation&#13;&#10;and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own&#13;&#10;children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so&#13;&#10;strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so&#13;&#10;unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising&#13;&#10;from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,&#13;&#10;might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even&#13;&#10;if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure she found little&#13;&#10;other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties&#13;&#10;abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and&#13;&#10;sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around&#13;&#10;them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty&#13;&#10;might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers&#13;&#10;of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition&#13;&#10;greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all&#13;&#10;her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a&#13;&#10;watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what&#13;&#10;has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had been&#13;&#10;looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the&#13;&#10;satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to&#13;&#10;name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity--to have&#13;&#10;some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by&#13;&#10;again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the&#13;&#10;present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes&#13;&#10;was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation&#13;&#10;for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother&#13;&#10;and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the&#13;&#10;scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish for.&#13;&#10;Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.&#13;&#10;But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my&#13;&#10;sister’s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of&#13;&#10;pleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can&#13;&#10;never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by&#13;&#10;the defence of some little peculiar vexation.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely&#13;&#10;to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and&#13;&#10;always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that&#13;&#10;they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers&#13;&#10;had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as&#13;&#10;made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which&#13;&#10;she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a&#13;&#10;violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to&#13;&#10;the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still&#13;&#10;less to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were&#13;&#10;much too full of lines under the words to be made public.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good&#13;&#10;humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore&#13;&#10;a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came&#13;&#10;back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet&#13;&#10;was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of&#13;&#10;June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without&#13;&#10;tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by&#13;&#10;the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to&#13;&#10;mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious&#13;&#10;arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in&#13;&#10;Meryton.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast&#13;&#10;approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter&#13;&#10;arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and&#13;&#10;curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from&#13;&#10;setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again&#13;&#10;within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so&#13;&#10;far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with&#13;&#10;the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up&#13;&#10;the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the&#13;&#10;present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that&#13;&#10;county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three&#13;&#10;weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The&#13;&#10;town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where&#13;&#10;they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of&#13;&#10;her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,&#13;&#10;Dovedale, or the Peak.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing&#13;&#10;the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it&#13;&#10;was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;&#13;&#10;and all was soon right again.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was&#13;&#10;impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its&#13;&#10;owner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity,&#13;&#10;and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away&#13;&#10;before her uncle and aunt’s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr.&#13;&#10;and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at&#13;&#10;Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two&#13;&#10;younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their&#13;&#10;cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and&#13;&#10;sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every&#13;&#10;way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the&#13;&#10;next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.&#13;&#10;One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness of companions;&#13;&#10;a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear&#13;&#10;inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection&#13;&#10;and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were&#13;&#10;disappointments abroad.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,&#13;&#10;nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither&#13;&#10;lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are&#13;&#10;sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present&#13;&#10;concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner’s&#13;&#10;former residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance&#13;&#10;still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the&#13;&#10;principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton,&#13;&#10;Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not&#13;&#10;in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In&#13;&#10;talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed&#13;&#10;an inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his&#13;&#10;willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard&#13;&#10;so much?” said her aunt; “a place, too, with which so many of your&#13;&#10;acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you&#13;&#10;know.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at&#13;&#10;Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She&#13;&#10;must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so&#13;&#10;many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine house&#13;&#10;richly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but&#13;&#10;the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the&#13;&#10;country.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce. The&#13;&#10;possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly&#13;&#10;occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and&#13;&#10;thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such&#13;&#10;a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved&#13;&#10;that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the&#13;&#10;absence of the family were unfavourably answered.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid&#13;&#10;whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its&#13;&#10;proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for&#13;&#10;the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her&#13;&#10;alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of&#13;&#10;curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the&#13;&#10;next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and&#13;&#10;with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike&#13;&#10;to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 43&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of&#13;&#10;Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned&#13;&#10;in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They&#13;&#10;entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through&#13;&#10;a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired&#13;&#10;every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for&#13;&#10;half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable&#13;&#10;eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by&#13;&#10;Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which&#13;&#10;the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone&#13;&#10;building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of&#13;&#10;high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was&#13;&#10;swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks&#13;&#10;were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She&#13;&#10;had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural&#13;&#10;beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were&#13;&#10;all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that&#13;&#10;to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,&#13;&#10;while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of&#13;&#10;meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been&#13;&#10;mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the&#13;&#10;hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to&#13;&#10;wonder at her being where she was.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less&#13;&#10;fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They&#13;&#10;followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned&#13;&#10;room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went&#13;&#10;to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which&#13;&#10;they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,&#13;&#10;was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and&#13;&#10;she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its&#13;&#10;banks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it,&#13;&#10;with delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking&#13;&#10;different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be&#13;&#10;seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to&#13;&#10;the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of&#13;&#10;his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of&#13;&#10;splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress! With&#13;&#10;these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of&#13;&#10;viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and&#13;&#10;welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,”--recollecting&#13;&#10;herself--“that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to&#13;&#10;me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something very like&#13;&#10;regret.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really&#13;&#10;absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question&#13;&#10;was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.&#13;&#10;Reynolds replied that he was, adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with&#13;&#10;a large party of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own&#13;&#10;journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the&#13;&#10;likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures,&#13;&#10;over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.&#13;&#10;The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young&#13;&#10;gentleman, the son of her late master’s steward, who had been brought&#13;&#10;up by him at his own expense. “He is now gone into the army,” she added;&#13;&#10;“but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not&#13;&#10;return it.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,&#13;&#10;“is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the&#13;&#10;other--about eight years ago.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I have heard much of your master’s fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner,&#13;&#10;looking at the picture; “it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell&#13;&#10;us whether it is like or not.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this&#13;&#10;intimation of her knowing her master.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth coloured, and said: “A little.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, very handsome.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you&#13;&#10;will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late&#13;&#10;master’s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to&#13;&#10;be then. He was very fond of them.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn&#13;&#10;when she was only eight years old.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mrs. Gardiner.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so&#13;&#10;accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is&#13;&#10;a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she&#13;&#10;comes here to-morrow with him.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her&#13;&#10;communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either&#13;&#10;by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her&#13;&#10;master and his sister.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his&#13;&#10;time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is&#13;&#10;good enough for him.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is&#13;&#10;very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him,”&#13;&#10; replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she&#13;&#10;listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, “I have&#13;&#10;never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever&#13;&#10;since he was four years old.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her&#13;&#10;ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.&#13;&#10;Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was&#13;&#10;grateful to her uncle for saying:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in&#13;&#10;having such a master.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could&#13;&#10;not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are&#13;&#10;good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and&#13;&#10;he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the&#13;&#10;world.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just&#13;&#10;as affable to the poor.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.&#13;&#10;Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects&#13;&#10;of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the&#13;&#10;furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family&#13;&#10;prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her&#13;&#10;master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his&#13;&#10;many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever&#13;&#10;lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but&#13;&#10;themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give&#13;&#10;him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw&#13;&#10;anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away&#13;&#10;like other young men.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not&#13;&#10;quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Perhaps we might be deceived.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty&#13;&#10;sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than&#13;&#10;the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to&#13;&#10;give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when&#13;&#10;last at Pemberley.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked towards&#13;&#10;one of the windows.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she should enter&#13;&#10;the room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added. “Whatever&#13;&#10;can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There&#13;&#10;is nothing he would not do for her.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were&#13;&#10;all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings;&#13;&#10;but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already&#13;&#10;visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss&#13;&#10;Darcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and&#13;&#10;also more intelligible.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have&#13;&#10;little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of&#13;&#10;the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested&#13;&#10;her--and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a&#13;&#10;smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he&#13;&#10;looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest&#13;&#10;contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.&#13;&#10;Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father’s&#13;&#10;lifetime.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more gentle&#13;&#10;sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of&#13;&#10;their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds&#13;&#10;was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise&#13;&#10;of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she&#13;&#10;considered how many people’s happiness were in his guardianship!--how&#13;&#10;much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much of&#13;&#10;good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought&#13;&#10;forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she&#13;&#10;stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his&#13;&#10;eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of&#13;&#10;gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and&#13;&#10;softened its impropriety of expression.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,&#13;&#10;they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were&#13;&#10;consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back&#13;&#10;to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former&#13;&#10;was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself&#13;&#10;suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his&#13;&#10;appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes&#13;&#10;instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest&#13;&#10;blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from&#13;&#10;surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,&#13;&#10;and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least&#13;&#10;of perfect civility.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,&#13;&#10;received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be&#13;&#10;overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture&#13;&#10;they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two&#13;&#10;that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s expression of surprise, on&#13;&#10;beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little&#13;&#10;aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,&#13;&#10;scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer&#13;&#10;she returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the&#13;&#10;alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that&#13;&#10;he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the&#13;&#10;impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few&#13;&#10;minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in&#13;&#10;her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent&#13;&#10;had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as&#13;&#10;to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in&#13;&#10;Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the&#13;&#10;distraction of his thoughts.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few&#13;&#10;moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took&#13;&#10;leave.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but&#13;&#10;Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,&#13;&#10;followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her&#13;&#10;coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the&#13;&#10;world! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light&#13;&#10;might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely&#13;&#10;thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he&#13;&#10;thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes&#13;&#10;sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination;&#13;&#10;for it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted&#13;&#10;from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over&#13;&#10;the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly&#13;&#10;altered--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was&#13;&#10;amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!&#13;&#10;Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never&#13;&#10;had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What&#13;&#10;a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put&#13;&#10;his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account&#13;&#10;for it.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and&#13;&#10;every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer&#13;&#10;reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time&#13;&#10;before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered&#13;&#10;mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and&#13;&#10;seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she&#13;&#10;distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that&#13;&#10;one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then&#13;&#10;was. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--in&#13;&#10;what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,&#13;&#10;she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he&#13;&#10;felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was&#13;&#10;not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in&#13;&#10;seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with&#13;&#10;composure.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind&#13;&#10;aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,&#13;&#10;ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of&#13;&#10;the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the&#13;&#10;valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading&#13;&#10;many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish&#13;&#10;of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.&#13;&#10;With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.&#13;&#10;It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which&#13;&#10;brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods,&#13;&#10;to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed&#13;&#10;it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene;&#13;&#10;it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the&#13;&#10;valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,&#13;&#10;and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.&#13;&#10;Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the&#13;&#10;bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,&#13;&#10;who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only&#13;&#10;of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,&#13;&#10;therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house&#13;&#10;on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their&#13;&#10;progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the&#13;&#10;taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the&#13;&#10;occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the&#13;&#10;man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this&#13;&#10;slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment&#13;&#10;was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy&#13;&#10;approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here&#13;&#10;less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before&#13;&#10;they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared&#13;&#10;for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with&#13;&#10;calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,&#13;&#10;she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea&#13;&#10;lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the&#13;&#10;turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw&#13;&#10;that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his&#13;&#10;politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;&#13;&#10;but she had not got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when&#13;&#10;some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of&#13;&#10;Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed,&#13;&#10;and she said no more.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked&#13;&#10;her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.&#13;&#10;This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared;&#13;&#10;and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the&#13;&#10;acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had&#13;&#10;revolted in his offer to herself. “What will be his surprise,” thought&#13;&#10;she, “when he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of&#13;&#10;fashion.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their&#13;&#10;relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore&#13;&#10;it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he&#13;&#10;could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the&#13;&#10;connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and&#13;&#10;so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into&#13;&#10;conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,&#13;&#10;could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had&#13;&#10;some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most&#13;&#10;attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every&#13;&#10;expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,&#13;&#10;his taste, or his good manners.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy&#13;&#10;invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he&#13;&#10;chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time&#13;&#10;to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of&#13;&#10;the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was&#13;&#10;walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.&#13;&#10;Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment&#13;&#10;must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and&#13;&#10;continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From what can&#13;&#10;it proceed? It cannot be for _me_--it cannot be for _my_ sake that his&#13;&#10;manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a&#13;&#10;change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two&#13;&#10;gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to&#13;&#10;the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious&#13;&#10;water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated&#13;&#10;in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found&#13;&#10;Elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred&#13;&#10;her husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on&#13;&#10;together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him&#13;&#10;to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the&#13;&#10;place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been&#13;&#10;very unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that&#13;&#10;you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we&#13;&#10;left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected&#13;&#10;in the country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that&#13;&#10;business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours&#13;&#10;before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “They&#13;&#10;will join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some&#13;&#10;who will claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly&#13;&#10;driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had been the last&#13;&#10;mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, _his_&#13;&#10;mind was not very differently engaged.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a&#13;&#10;pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow&#13;&#10;me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance&#13;&#10;during your stay at Lambton?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great&#13;&#10;for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt&#13;&#10;that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her&#13;&#10;must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was&#13;&#10;satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made&#13;&#10;him think really ill of her.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth&#13;&#10;was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and&#13;&#10;pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of&#13;&#10;the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had&#13;&#10;reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a&#13;&#10;mile behind.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not&#13;&#10;tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might&#13;&#10;have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but&#13;&#10;there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected&#13;&#10;that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale&#13;&#10;with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her&#13;&#10;patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was&#13;&#10;over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go&#13;&#10;into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and&#13;&#10;they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the&#13;&#10;ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him&#13;&#10;walking slowly towards the house.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them&#13;&#10;pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.&#13;&#10;“He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her&#13;&#10;aunt, “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now&#13;&#10;say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I&#13;&#10;have seen nothing of it.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more&#13;&#10;than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such&#13;&#10;attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham;&#13;&#10;or, rather, he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his features&#13;&#10;are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so&#13;&#10;disagreeable?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked&#13;&#10;him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never&#13;&#10;seen him so pleasant as this morning.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied&#13;&#10;her uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him&#13;&#10;at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off&#13;&#10;his grounds.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but&#13;&#10;said nothing.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really&#13;&#10;should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by&#13;&#10;anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.&#13;&#10;On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he&#13;&#10;speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would&#13;&#10;not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the&#13;&#10;good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!&#13;&#10;I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal&#13;&#10;master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every&#13;&#10;virtue.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of&#13;&#10;his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in&#13;&#10;as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from&#13;&#10;his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different&#13;&#10;construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor&#13;&#10;Wickham’s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In&#13;&#10;confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary&#13;&#10;transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming&#13;&#10;her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now&#13;&#10;approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to&#13;&#10;the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out&#13;&#10;to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of&#13;&#10;anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk they&#13;&#10;had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former&#13;&#10;acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a&#13;&#10;intercourse renewed after many years’ discontinuance.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth&#13;&#10;much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing&#13;&#10;but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s civility, and, above&#13;&#10;all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 44&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit&#13;&#10;her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently&#13;&#10;resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.&#13;&#10;But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their&#13;&#10;arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the&#13;&#10;place with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn&#13;&#10;to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a&#13;&#10;carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in&#13;&#10;a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing&#13;&#10;the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her&#13;&#10;surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she&#13;&#10;expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment&#13;&#10;of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many&#13;&#10;of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on&#13;&#10;the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that&#13;&#10;there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a&#13;&#10;quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these&#13;&#10;newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of&#13;&#10;Elizabeth’s feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite&#13;&#10;amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet,&#13;&#10;she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much&#13;&#10;in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally&#13;&#10;suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked&#13;&#10;up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of&#13;&#10;inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction&#13;&#10;took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new&#13;&#10;acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her&#13;&#10;being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;&#13;&#10;but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was&#13;&#10;only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from&#13;&#10;her beyond a monosyllable.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though&#13;&#10;little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance&#13;&#10;womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there&#13;&#10;was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly&#13;&#10;unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as&#13;&#10;acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much&#13;&#10;relieved by discerning such different feelings.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley&#13;&#10;was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her&#13;&#10;satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley’s quick&#13;&#10;step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All&#13;&#10;Elizabeth’s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still&#13;&#10;felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected&#13;&#10;cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He&#13;&#10;inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked&#13;&#10;and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage&#13;&#10;than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before&#13;&#10;them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just&#13;&#10;arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards&#13;&#10;each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from&#13;&#10;those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew&#13;&#10;what it was to love. Of the lady’s sensations they remained a little&#13;&#10;in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was&#13;&#10;evident enough.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the&#13;&#10;feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and&#13;&#10;to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she&#13;&#10;feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she&#13;&#10;endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley&#13;&#10;was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!&#13;&#10;how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in&#13;&#10;a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on&#13;&#10;former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion&#13;&#10;that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,&#13;&#10;though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his&#13;&#10;behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look&#13;&#10;appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred&#13;&#10;between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point&#13;&#10;she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred&#13;&#10;ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a&#13;&#10;recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying&#13;&#10;more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed&#13;&#10;to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone&#13;&#10;which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long time since&#13;&#10;he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could reply,&#13;&#10;he added, “It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of&#13;&#10;November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards&#13;&#10;took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether&#13;&#10;_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,&#13;&#10;nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which&#13;&#10;gave them meaning.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself;&#13;&#10;but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general&#13;&#10;complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed&#13;&#10;from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that&#13;&#10;the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however&#13;&#10;temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When&#13;&#10;she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion&#13;&#10;of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a&#13;&#10;disgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the&#13;&#10;very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last&#13;&#10;lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was&#13;&#10;so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly&#13;&#10;restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company&#13;&#10;of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations&#13;&#10;at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from&#13;&#10;self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance&#13;&#10;could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the&#13;&#10;acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw&#13;&#10;down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and&#13;&#10;Rosings.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose&#13;&#10;to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing&#13;&#10;their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner&#13;&#10;at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a&#13;&#10;diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,&#13;&#10;readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing&#13;&#10;how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its&#13;&#10;acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however,&#13;&#10;that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than&#13;&#10;any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of&#13;&#10;society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for&#13;&#10;her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth&#13;&#10;again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to&#13;&#10;make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all&#13;&#10;this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on&#13;&#10;this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their&#13;&#10;visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some&#13;&#10;satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been&#13;&#10;little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her&#13;&#10;uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their&#13;&#10;favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity; it was&#13;&#10;not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was&#13;&#10;much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;&#13;&#10;it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to&#13;&#10;interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far&#13;&#10;as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could&#13;&#10;not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character&#13;&#10;from their own feelings and his servant’s report, without any reference&#13;&#10;to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known&#13;&#10;would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,&#13;&#10;however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible&#13;&#10;that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four&#13;&#10;years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be&#13;&#10;hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of&#13;&#10;their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had&#13;&#10;nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,&#13;&#10;it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town&#13;&#10;where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he&#13;&#10;was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held&#13;&#10;there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the&#13;&#10;son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known&#13;&#10;fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind&#13;&#10;him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than&#13;&#10;the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not&#13;&#10;long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion;&#13;&#10;and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She&#13;&#10;certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she&#13;&#10;had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,&#13;&#10;that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his&#13;&#10;valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some&#13;&#10;time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened&#13;&#10;into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in&#13;&#10;his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,&#13;&#10;which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,&#13;&#10;there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.&#13;&#10;It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,&#13;&#10;but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and&#13;&#10;acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations&#13;&#10;accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid&#13;&#10;her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most&#13;&#10;eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display&#13;&#10;of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only&#13;&#10;were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent&#13;&#10;on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much&#13;&#10;pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent&#13;&#10;love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a&#13;&#10;sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be&#13;&#10;exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,&#13;&#10;she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how&#13;&#10;far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would&#13;&#10;be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her&#13;&#10;fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of&#13;&#10;his addresses.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that&#13;&#10;such a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s in coming to see them on the&#13;&#10;very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a&#13;&#10;late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled,&#13;&#10;by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that&#13;&#10;it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following&#13;&#10;morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when&#13;&#10;she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been&#13;&#10;renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting&#13;&#10;some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 45&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley’s dislike of her had&#13;&#10;originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her&#13;&#10;appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how&#13;&#10;much civility on that lady’s side the acquaintance would now be renewed.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,&#13;&#10;whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows&#13;&#10;opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody&#13;&#10;hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts&#13;&#10;which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there&#13;&#10;with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in&#13;&#10;London. Georgiana’s reception of them was very civil, but attended with&#13;&#10;all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear&#13;&#10;of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior&#13;&#10;the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,&#13;&#10;however, did her justice, and pitied her.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and,&#13;&#10;on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,&#13;&#10;succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a&#13;&#10;genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind&#13;&#10;of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the&#13;&#10;others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she&#13;&#10;wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a&#13;&#10;short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,&#13;&#10;and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without&#13;&#10;calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her&#13;&#10;from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an&#13;&#10;inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity&#13;&#10;of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every&#13;&#10;moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she&#13;&#10;feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether&#13;&#10;she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After&#13;&#10;sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss&#13;&#10;Bingley’s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold&#13;&#10;inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal&#13;&#10;indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the&#13;&#10;entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the&#13;&#10;finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many&#13;&#10;a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been&#13;&#10;given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole&#13;&#10;party--for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the&#13;&#10;beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected&#13;&#10;them round the table.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether&#13;&#10;she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the&#13;&#10;feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but&#13;&#10;a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to&#13;&#10;regret that he came.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other&#13;&#10;gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him&#13;&#10;only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to&#13;&#10;Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely&#13;&#10;resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more&#13;&#10;necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she&#13;&#10;saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,&#13;&#10;and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour&#13;&#10;when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive&#13;&#10;curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of the&#13;&#10;smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its&#13;&#10;objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions&#13;&#10;to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother’s&#13;&#10;entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he&#13;&#10;was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded&#13;&#10;as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss&#13;&#10;Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the&#13;&#10;first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from Meryton?&#13;&#10;They must be a great loss to _your_ family.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name; but Elizabeth&#13;&#10;instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the&#13;&#10;various recollections connected with him gave her a moment’s distress;&#13;&#10;but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she&#13;&#10;presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While&#13;&#10;she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened&#13;&#10;complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with&#13;&#10;confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what&#13;&#10;pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would&#13;&#10;have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose&#13;&#10;Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed&#13;&#10;her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in&#13;&#10;Darcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies&#13;&#10;and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected&#13;&#10;with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy’s&#13;&#10;meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy&#13;&#10;was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s connections&#13;&#10;her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very&#13;&#10;wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming&#13;&#10;hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without&#13;&#10;meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss&#13;&#10;Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern&#13;&#10;for the welfare of his friend.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and&#13;&#10;as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to&#13;&#10;Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able&#13;&#10;to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely&#13;&#10;recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which&#13;&#10;had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have&#13;&#10;fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above&#13;&#10;mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss&#13;&#10;Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth’s person,&#13;&#10;behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother’s&#13;&#10;recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not&#13;&#10;err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana&#13;&#10;without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When&#13;&#10;Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to&#13;&#10;him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,” she&#13;&#10;cried; “I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since&#13;&#10;the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing&#13;&#10;that we should not have known her again.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented&#13;&#10;himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than&#13;&#10;her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the&#13;&#10;summer.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could&#13;&#10;see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no&#13;&#10;brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose&#13;&#10;wants character--there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are&#13;&#10;tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes,&#13;&#10;which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything&#13;&#10;extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do&#13;&#10;not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency&#13;&#10;without fashion, which is intolerable.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not&#13;&#10;the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always&#13;&#10;wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the&#13;&#10;success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a&#13;&#10;determination of making him speak, she continued:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all&#13;&#10;were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect&#13;&#10;your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, ‘_She_&#13;&#10;a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.’ But afterwards she&#13;&#10;seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at&#13;&#10;one time.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but _that_&#13;&#10;was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have&#13;&#10;considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of&#13;&#10;having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their&#13;&#10;visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them&#13;&#10;both. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,&#13;&#10;except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked&#13;&#10;of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--of everything but&#13;&#10;himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of&#13;&#10;him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece’s&#13;&#10;beginning the subject.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 46&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from&#13;&#10;Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been&#13;&#10;renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but&#13;&#10;on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the&#13;&#10;receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that&#13;&#10;it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as&#13;&#10;Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and&#13;&#10;her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by&#13;&#10;themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had been&#13;&#10;written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their&#13;&#10;little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;&#13;&#10;but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident&#13;&#10;agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a&#13;&#10;most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be&#13;&#10;assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.&#13;&#10;An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,&#13;&#10;from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland&#13;&#10;with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our&#13;&#10;surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am&#13;&#10;very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing&#13;&#10;to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.&#13;&#10;Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step&#13;&#10;(and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is&#13;&#10;disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.&#13;&#10;Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How&#13;&#10;thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against&#13;&#10;him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about&#13;&#10;twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at&#13;&#10;eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have&#13;&#10;passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect&#13;&#10;him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of&#13;&#10;their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor&#13;&#10;mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly&#13;&#10;know what I have written.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing&#13;&#10;what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the&#13;&#10;other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it&#13;&#10;had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I&#13;&#10;wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my&#13;&#10;head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest&#13;&#10;Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,&#13;&#10;and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham&#13;&#10;and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has&#13;&#10;taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone&#13;&#10;to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the&#13;&#10;day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia’s short&#13;&#10;letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna&#13;&#10;Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.&#13;&#10;never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was&#13;&#10;repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.&#13;&#10;intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham,&#13;&#10;but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney&#13;&#10;coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that&#13;&#10;is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.&#13;&#10;I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that&#13;&#10;side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing&#13;&#10;them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but&#13;&#10;without any success--no such people had been seen to pass through. With&#13;&#10;the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions&#13;&#10;to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved&#13;&#10;for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our&#13;&#10;distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the&#13;&#10;worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make&#13;&#10;it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue&#13;&#10;their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a&#13;&#10;young woman of Lydia’s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose&#13;&#10;her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that&#13;&#10;Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his&#13;&#10;head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to&#13;&#10;be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she&#13;&#10;exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And&#13;&#10;as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has&#13;&#10;anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of&#13;&#10;confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you&#13;&#10;have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the&#13;&#10;first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not&#13;&#10;so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I&#13;&#10;take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but&#13;&#10;circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to&#13;&#10;come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well,&#13;&#10;that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something&#13;&#10;more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel&#13;&#10;Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure&#13;&#10;I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any&#13;&#10;measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to&#13;&#10;be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my&#13;&#10;uncle’s advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will&#13;&#10;immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat&#13;&#10;as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing&#13;&#10;a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was&#13;&#10;opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous&#13;&#10;manner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak,&#13;&#10;she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia’s situation,&#13;&#10;hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find&#13;&#10;Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not&#13;&#10;an instant to lose.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Good God! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than&#13;&#10;politeness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a minute;&#13;&#10;but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are&#13;&#10;not well enough; you cannot go yourself.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how&#13;&#10;little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back&#13;&#10;the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless&#13;&#10;an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and&#13;&#10;mistress home instantly.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and&#13;&#10;looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,&#13;&#10;or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,&#13;&#10;“Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you&#13;&#10;present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “There&#13;&#10;is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by&#13;&#10;some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could&#13;&#10;not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say&#13;&#10;something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate&#13;&#10;silence. At length she spoke again. “I have just had a letter from Jane,&#13;&#10;with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger&#13;&#10;sister has left all her friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into&#13;&#10;the power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton.&#13;&#10;_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no&#13;&#10;connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Darcy was fixed in astonishment. “When I consider,” she added in a yet&#13;&#10;more agitated voice, “that I might have prevented it! I, who knew what&#13;&#10;he was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I&#13;&#10;learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not&#13;&#10;have happened. But it is all--all too late now.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am grieved indeed,” cried Darcy; “grieved--shocked. But is it&#13;&#10;certain--absolutely certain?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced&#13;&#10;almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to&#13;&#10;Scotland.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle’s&#13;&#10;immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But&#13;&#10;nothing can be done--I know very well that nothing can be done. How is&#13;&#10;such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have&#13;&#10;not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character--Oh! had I known what&#13;&#10;I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too&#13;&#10;much. Wretched, wretched mistake!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking&#13;&#10;up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air&#13;&#10;gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her&#13;&#10;power was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family&#13;&#10;weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither&#13;&#10;wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing&#13;&#10;consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It&#13;&#10;was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own&#13;&#10;wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved&#13;&#10;him, as now, when all love must be vain.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the&#13;&#10;humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed&#13;&#10;up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,&#13;&#10;Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of&#13;&#10;several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by&#13;&#10;the voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke&#13;&#10;compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, “I am afraid you have been&#13;&#10;long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my&#13;&#10;stay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything&#13;&#10;could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to&#13;&#10;such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may&#13;&#10;seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I&#13;&#10;fear, prevent my sister’s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley&#13;&#10;to-day.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that&#13;&#10;urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as&#13;&#10;long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for&#13;&#10;her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present&#13;&#10;reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only&#13;&#10;one serious, parting look, went away.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they&#13;&#10;should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as&#13;&#10;had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a&#13;&#10;retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full&#13;&#10;of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those&#13;&#10;feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would&#13;&#10;formerly have rejoiced in its termination.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth’s&#13;&#10;change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if&#13;&#10;otherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or&#13;&#10;unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on&#13;&#10;a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been&#13;&#10;exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given&#13;&#10;somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham,&#13;&#10;and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other&#13;&#10;less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him&#13;&#10;go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia’s infamy must&#13;&#10;produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched&#13;&#10;business. Never, since reading Jane’s second letter, had she entertained&#13;&#10;a hope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,&#13;&#10;could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least&#13;&#10;of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first&#13;&#10;letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that&#13;&#10;Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry&#13;&#10;for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared&#13;&#10;incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment&#13;&#10;as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose&#13;&#10;Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention&#13;&#10;of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue&#13;&#10;nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that&#13;&#10;Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia&#13;&#10;wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one&#13;&#10;officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions&#13;&#10;raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been&#13;&#10;fluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and&#13;&#10;mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now&#13;&#10;feel it!&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to&#13;&#10;share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a&#13;&#10;family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and&#13;&#10;requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing&#13;&#10;could be done for Lydia, her uncle’s interference seemed of the utmost&#13;&#10;importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr.&#13;&#10;and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant’s&#13;&#10;account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them&#13;&#10;instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their&#13;&#10;summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript&#13;&#10;of the last with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had never been a&#13;&#10;favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply&#13;&#10;afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the&#13;&#10;first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every&#13;&#10;assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked&#13;&#10;him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit,&#13;&#10;everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to&#13;&#10;be off as soon as possible. “But what is to be done about Pemberley?”&#13;&#10; cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for&#13;&#10;us; was it so?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.&#13;&#10;_That_ is all settled.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“What is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to&#13;&#10;prepare. “And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real&#13;&#10;truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the&#13;&#10;hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure&#13;&#10;to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was&#13;&#10;impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of&#13;&#10;business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to&#13;&#10;be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their&#13;&#10;sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.&#13;&#10;Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing&#13;&#10;remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of&#13;&#10;the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could&#13;&#10;have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 47&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they&#13;&#10;drove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I am much&#13;&#10;more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the&#13;&#10;matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should&#13;&#10;form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or&#13;&#10;friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel’s family, that I&#13;&#10;am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends&#13;&#10;would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the&#13;&#10;regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is&#13;&#10;not adequate to the risk!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle’s&#13;&#10;opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and&#13;&#10;interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of&#13;&#10;Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe&#13;&#10;him capable of it?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other&#13;&#10;neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I&#13;&#10;dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been&#13;&#10;the case?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof&#13;&#10;that they are not gone to Scotland.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such&#13;&#10;a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the&#13;&#10;Barnet road.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though&#13;&#10;for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is&#13;&#10;not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it&#13;&#10;might strike them that they could be more economically, though less&#13;&#10;expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their&#13;&#10;marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular&#13;&#10;friend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending&#13;&#10;to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He&#13;&#10;cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she&#13;&#10;beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake,&#13;&#10;forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what&#13;&#10;restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a&#13;&#10;dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know&#13;&#10;nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your&#13;&#10;other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has&#13;&#10;no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father’s&#13;&#10;behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever&#13;&#10;seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would&#13;&#10;do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in&#13;&#10;such a matter.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him&#13;&#10;as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,” replied Elizabeth, with&#13;&#10;tears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decency and virtue in such&#13;&#10;a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.&#13;&#10;Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never&#13;&#10;been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year,&#13;&#10;nay, for a twelvemonth--she has been given up to nothing but amusement&#13;&#10;and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle&#13;&#10;and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.&#13;&#10;Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,&#13;&#10;flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing&#13;&#10;everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give&#13;&#10;greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are&#13;&#10;naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of&#13;&#10;person and address that can captivate a woman.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so very ill of&#13;&#10;Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be&#13;&#10;their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt,&#13;&#10;till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what&#13;&#10;Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every&#13;&#10;sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is&#13;&#10;as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity&#13;&#10;as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I do indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you, the other day,&#13;&#10;of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at&#13;&#10;Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved&#13;&#10;with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other&#13;&#10;circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to&#13;&#10;relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From&#13;&#10;what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,&#13;&#10;reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He&#13;&#10;must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found&#13;&#10;her.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you&#13;&#10;and Jane seem so well to understand?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw&#13;&#10;so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was&#13;&#10;ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ----shire&#13;&#10;was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight’s time. As that was the&#13;&#10;case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it&#13;&#10;necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could&#13;&#10;it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the&#13;&#10;neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was&#13;&#10;settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening&#13;&#10;her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be&#13;&#10;in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a&#13;&#10;consequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was far&#13;&#10;enough from my thoughts.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I&#13;&#10;suppose, to believe them fond of each other?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either&#13;&#10;side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware&#13;&#10;that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first&#13;&#10;he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all&#13;&#10;were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for&#13;&#10;the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular&#13;&#10;attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and&#13;&#10;wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,&#13;&#10;who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;                          * * * * *&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added&#13;&#10;to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by&#13;&#10;its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during&#13;&#10;the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth’s thoughts it was never absent.&#13;&#10;Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find&#13;&#10;no interval of ease or forgetfulness.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night&#13;&#10;on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a&#13;&#10;comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied&#13;&#10;by long expectations.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing&#13;&#10;on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the&#13;&#10;carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their&#13;&#10;faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of&#13;&#10;capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss,&#13;&#10;hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her&#13;&#10;mother’s apartment, immediately met her.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the&#13;&#10;eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been&#13;&#10;heard of the fugitives.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Not yet,” replied Jane. “But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope&#13;&#10;everything will be well.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Is my father in town?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And have you heard from him often?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say&#13;&#10;that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I&#13;&#10;particularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write&#13;&#10;again till he had something of importance to mention.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And my mother--how is she? How are you all?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly&#13;&#10;shaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you&#13;&#10;all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank&#13;&#10;Heaven, are quite well.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But you--how are you?” cried Elizabeth. “You look pale. How much you&#13;&#10;must have gone through!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their&#13;&#10;conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were&#13;&#10;engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach&#13;&#10;of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and&#13;&#10;thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth&#13;&#10;had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon&#13;&#10;found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of&#13;&#10;good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet&#13;&#10;deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that&#13;&#10;every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,&#13;&#10;to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes’&#13;&#10;conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with&#13;&#10;tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous&#13;&#10;conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;&#13;&#10;blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the&#13;&#10;errors of her daughter must principally be owing.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to Brighton,&#13;&#10;with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia&#13;&#10;had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out&#13;&#10;of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their&#13;&#10;side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been&#13;&#10;well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the&#13;&#10;charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child!&#13;&#10;And now here’s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham,&#13;&#10;wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become&#13;&#10;of us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his&#13;&#10;grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we&#13;&#10;shall do.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after&#13;&#10;general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her&#13;&#10;that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.&#13;&#10;Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he; “though it is right to be&#13;&#10;prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.&#13;&#10;It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we&#13;&#10;may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,&#13;&#10;and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as&#13;&#10;lost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make&#13;&#10;him come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult&#13;&#10;together as to what is to be done.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what I&#13;&#10;could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,&#13;&#10;wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them&#13;&#10;marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but&#13;&#10;tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,&#13;&#10;after they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.&#13;&#10;Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my&#13;&#10;wits--and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me--such&#13;&#10;spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that&#13;&#10;I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to&#13;&#10;give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does&#13;&#10;not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I&#13;&#10;know you will contrive it all.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours&#13;&#10;in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well&#13;&#10;in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till&#13;&#10;dinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on&#13;&#10;the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real&#13;&#10;occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to&#13;&#10;oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her&#13;&#10;tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it&#13;&#10;better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could&#13;&#10;most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the&#13;&#10;subject.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been&#13;&#10;too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance&#13;&#10;before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The&#13;&#10;faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible&#13;&#10;in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger&#13;&#10;which she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of&#13;&#10;fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was&#13;&#10;mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance&#13;&#10;of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.&#13;&#10;But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of&#13;&#10;each other the balm of sisterly consolation.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,&#13;&#10;“Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful&#13;&#10;lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one&#13;&#10;false step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less&#13;&#10;brittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in&#13;&#10;her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed&#13;&#10;to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such&#13;&#10;kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for&#13;&#10;half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of&#13;&#10;the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to&#13;&#10;satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel&#13;&#10;of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss&#13;&#10;Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued&#13;&#10;the subject, by saying, “But tell me all and everything about it which&#13;&#10;I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel&#13;&#10;Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement&#13;&#10;took place? They must have seen them together for ever.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,&#13;&#10;especially on Lydia’s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so&#13;&#10;grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He&#13;&#10;_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had&#13;&#10;any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension&#13;&#10;first got abroad, it hastened his journey.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of&#13;&#10;their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes; but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of&#13;&#10;their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not&#13;&#10;repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am&#13;&#10;inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a&#13;&#10;doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt&#13;&#10;a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister’s happiness with him&#13;&#10;in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite&#13;&#10;right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how&#13;&#10;imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural&#13;&#10;triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia’s last letter&#13;&#10;she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their&#13;&#10;being in love with each other, many weeks.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But not before they went to Brighton?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No, I believe not.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does&#13;&#10;he know his real character?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly&#13;&#10;did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad&#13;&#10;affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt;&#13;&#10;but I hope this may be false.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,&#13;&#10;this could not have happened!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister. “But to expose&#13;&#10;the former faults of any person without knowing what their present&#13;&#10;feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia’s note to his&#13;&#10;wife?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“He brought it with him for us to see.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These&#13;&#10;were the contents:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“MY DEAR HARRIET,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help&#13;&#10;laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am&#13;&#10;missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who,&#13;&#10;I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I&#13;&#10;love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so think&#13;&#10;it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of my&#13;&#10;going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater,&#13;&#10;when I write to them and sign my name ‘Lydia Wickham.’ What a good joke&#13;&#10;it will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to&#13;&#10;Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night.&#13;&#10;Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will&#13;&#10;dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall&#13;&#10;send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell&#13;&#10;Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are&#13;&#10;packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will&#13;&#10;drink to our good journey.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Your affectionate friend,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“LYDIA BENNET.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she had&#13;&#10;finished it. “What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment!&#13;&#10;But at least it shows that _she_ was serious on the subject of their&#13;&#10;journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her&#13;&#10;side a _scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten&#13;&#10;minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in&#13;&#10;such confusion!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! Jane,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it who&#13;&#10;did not know the whole story before the end of the day?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is&#13;&#10;very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to&#13;&#10;give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so&#13;&#10;much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen&#13;&#10;almost took from me my faculties.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look&#13;&#10;well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety&#13;&#10;upon yourself alone.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every&#13;&#10;fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them.&#13;&#10;Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours&#13;&#10;of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn&#13;&#10;on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till&#13;&#10;Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And&#13;&#10;Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to&#13;&#10;condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters’, if&#13;&#10;they should be of use to us.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“She had better have stayed at home,” cried Elizabeth; “perhaps she&#13;&#10;_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see&#13;&#10;too little of one’s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence&#13;&#10;insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had&#13;&#10;intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“He meant I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place where&#13;&#10;they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could&#13;&#10;be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the&#13;&#10;number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come&#13;&#10;with a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a&#13;&#10;gentleman and lady’s removing from one carriage into another might&#13;&#10;be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow&#13;&#10;discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he&#13;&#10;determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible&#13;&#10;to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any&#13;&#10;other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,&#13;&#10;and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding&#13;&#10;out even so much as this.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 48&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next&#13;&#10;morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.&#13;&#10;His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and&#13;&#10;dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.&#13;&#10;They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to&#13;&#10;send; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.&#13;&#10;Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant&#13;&#10;information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,&#13;&#10;to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could,&#13;&#10;to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only&#13;&#10;security for her husband’s not being killed in a duel.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few&#13;&#10;days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable&#13;&#10;to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a&#13;&#10;great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also&#13;&#10;visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of&#13;&#10;cheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without&#13;&#10;reporting some fresh instance of Wickham’s extravagance or irregularity,&#13;&#10;she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found&#13;&#10;them.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months&#13;&#10;before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt&#13;&#10;to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with&#13;&#10;the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman’s family.&#13;&#10;Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;&#13;&#10;and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the&#13;&#10;appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above&#13;&#10;half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of&#13;&#10;her sister’s ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less&#13;&#10;of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come&#13;&#10;when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely&#13;&#10;despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of&#13;&#10;them.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a&#13;&#10;letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately&#13;&#10;found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street;&#13;&#10;that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival,&#13;&#10;but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now&#13;&#10;determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet&#13;&#10;thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first&#13;&#10;coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself&#13;&#10;did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was&#13;&#10;eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr.&#13;&#10;Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised&#13;&#10;to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if&#13;&#10;possible, from some of the young man’s intimates in the regiment,&#13;&#10;whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to&#13;&#10;know in what part of town he has now concealed himself. If there were&#13;&#10;anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a&#13;&#10;clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have&#13;&#10;nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in&#13;&#10;his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps,&#13;&#10;Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any&#13;&#10;other person.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her&#13;&#10;authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information&#13;&#10;of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. She had never&#13;&#10;heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both&#13;&#10;of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of&#13;&#10;his companions in the ----shire might be able to give more information;&#13;&#10;and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application&#13;&#10;was a something to look forward to.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious&#13;&#10;part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters&#13;&#10;was the grand object of every morning’s impatience. Through letters,&#13;&#10;whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every&#13;&#10;succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for&#13;&#10;their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane&#13;&#10;had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,&#13;&#10;she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his&#13;&#10;letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as&#13;&#10;follows:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“MY DEAR SIR,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation&#13;&#10;in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now&#13;&#10;suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from&#13;&#10;Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself&#13;&#10;sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in&#13;&#10;your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because&#13;&#10;proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be&#13;&#10;wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune--or that&#13;&#10;may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the&#13;&#10;most afflicting to a parent’s mind. The death of your daughter would&#13;&#10;have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to&#13;&#10;be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte&#13;&#10;informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has&#13;&#10;proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time,&#13;&#10;for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think&#13;&#10;that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be&#13;&#10;guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be,&#13;&#10;you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined&#13;&#10;by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to&#13;&#10;whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that&#13;&#10;this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of&#13;&#10;all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says,&#13;&#10;will connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads&#13;&#10;me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event&#13;&#10;of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved&#13;&#10;in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to&#13;&#10;console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child&#13;&#10;from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her&#13;&#10;own heinous offense.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am, dear sir, etc., etc.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from&#13;&#10;Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.&#13;&#10;It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he&#13;&#10;kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one&#13;&#10;living. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he&#13;&#10;had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of&#13;&#10;particular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore,&#13;&#10;who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the&#13;&#10;wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for&#13;&#10;secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia’s relations, for&#13;&#10;it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a&#13;&#10;very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a&#13;&#10;thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.&#13;&#10;He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more&#13;&#10;formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars&#13;&#10;from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. “A gamester!”&#13;&#10; she cried. “This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their&#13;&#10;father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered&#13;&#10;spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded&#13;&#10;to his brother-in-law’s entreaty that he would return to his family, and&#13;&#10;leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable&#13;&#10;for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did&#13;&#10;not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering&#13;&#10;what her anxiety for his life had been before.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?” she cried. “Sure he&#13;&#10;will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,&#13;&#10;and make him marry her, if he comes away?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she&#13;&#10;and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet&#13;&#10;came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their&#13;&#10;journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her&#13;&#10;Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. His&#13;&#10;name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and&#13;&#10;the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their&#13;&#10;being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had&#13;&#10;received none since her return that could come from Pemberley.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for&#13;&#10;the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be&#13;&#10;fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time&#13;&#10;tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware&#13;&#10;that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of&#13;&#10;Lydia’s infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,&#13;&#10;one sleepless night out of two.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual&#13;&#10;philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the&#13;&#10;habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him&#13;&#10;away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of&#13;&#10;it.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that&#13;&#10;Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly&#13;&#10;expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, “Say&#13;&#10;nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,&#13;&#10;and I ought to feel it.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone&#13;&#10;to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have&#13;&#10;been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.&#13;&#10;It will pass away soon enough.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Do you suppose them to be in London?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“She is happy then,” said her father drily; “and her residence there&#13;&#10;will probably be of some duration.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Then after a short silence he continued:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me&#13;&#10;last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother’s&#13;&#10;tea.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“This is a parade,” he cried, “which does one good; it gives such an&#13;&#10;elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my&#13;&#10;library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as&#13;&#10;I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am not going to run away, papa,” said Kitty fretfully. “If I should&#13;&#10;ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“_You_ go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne&#13;&#10;for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and&#13;&#10;you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into&#13;&#10;my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be&#13;&#10;absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.&#13;&#10;And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have&#13;&#10;spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good&#13;&#10;girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of&#13;&#10;them.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 49&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Two days after Mr. Bennet’s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking&#13;&#10;together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper&#13;&#10;coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their&#13;&#10;mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,&#13;&#10;when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, “I beg your pardon,&#13;&#10;madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some&#13;&#10;good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Dear madam,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don’t you know&#13;&#10;there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here&#13;&#10;this half-hour, and master has had a letter.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They&#13;&#10;ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the&#13;&#10;library; their father was in neither; and they were on the point of&#13;&#10;seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the&#13;&#10;butler, who said:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“If you are looking for my master, ma’am, he is walking towards the&#13;&#10;little copse.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once&#13;&#10;more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately&#13;&#10;pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,&#13;&#10;came up with him, and eagerly cried out:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh, papa, what news--what news? Have you heard from my uncle?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes I have had a letter from him by express.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“What is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the letter from&#13;&#10;his pocket. “But perhaps you would like to read it.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Read it aloud,” said their father, “for I hardly know myself what it is&#13;&#10;about.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“MY DEAR BROTHER,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as,&#13;&#10;upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you&#13;&#10;left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of&#13;&#10;London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough&#13;&#10;to know they are discovered. I have seen them both--”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Then it is as I always hoped,” cried Jane; “they are married!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth read on:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there&#13;&#10;was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the&#13;&#10;engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will&#13;&#10;not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure&#13;&#10;to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand&#13;&#10;pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and&#13;&#10;my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her,&#13;&#10;during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions&#13;&#10;which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with,&#13;&#10;as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by&#13;&#10;express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You&#13;&#10;will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham’s&#13;&#10;circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.&#13;&#10;The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there&#13;&#10;will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to&#13;&#10;settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude&#13;&#10;will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout&#13;&#10;the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to&#13;&#10;Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the&#13;&#10;smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at&#13;&#10;Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as&#13;&#10;fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it&#13;&#10;best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope&#13;&#10;you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as&#13;&#10;anything more is determined on. Yours, etc.,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“EDW. GARDINER.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Is it possible?” cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. “Can it be&#13;&#10;possible that he will marry her?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,” said her&#13;&#10;sister. “My dear father, I congratulate you.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And have you answered the letter?” cried Elizabeth.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No; but it must be done soon.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he&#13;&#10;wrote.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write immediately.&#13;&#10;Consider how important every moment is in such a case.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Let me write for you,” said Jane, “if you dislike the trouble&#13;&#10;yourself.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I dislike it very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And may I ask--” said Elizabeth; “but the terms, I suppose, must be&#13;&#10;complied with.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there&#13;&#10;are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money&#13;&#10;your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever&#13;&#10;to pay him.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Money! My uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, sir?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a&#13;&#10;temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am&#13;&#10;gone.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred to me&#13;&#10;before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh!&#13;&#10;it must be my uncle’s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has&#13;&#10;distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No,” said her father; “Wickham’s a fool if he takes her with a farthing&#13;&#10;less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him,&#13;&#10;in the very beginning of our relationship.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be&#13;&#10;repaid?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued&#13;&#10;silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the&#13;&#10;library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth, as soon as they&#13;&#10;were by themselves. “How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be&#13;&#10;thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,&#13;&#10;and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that he certainly would&#13;&#10;not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind&#13;&#10;uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten&#13;&#10;thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children&#13;&#10;of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand&#13;&#10;pounds?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“If he were ever able to learn what Wickham’s debts have been,” said&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall&#13;&#10;exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has&#13;&#10;not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never&#13;&#10;be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal&#13;&#10;protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as&#13;&#10;years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is&#13;&#10;actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,&#13;&#10;she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she&#13;&#10;first sees my aunt!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,” said&#13;&#10;Jane: “I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to&#13;&#10;marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of&#13;&#10;thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself&#13;&#10;they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in&#13;&#10;time make their past imprudence forgotten.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither you, nor&#13;&#10;I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood&#13;&#10;perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,&#13;&#10;therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make&#13;&#10;it known to her. He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly&#13;&#10;replied:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Just as you please.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“May we take my uncle’s letter to read to her?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Take whatever you like, and get away.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairs&#13;&#10;together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication&#13;&#10;would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,&#13;&#10;the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As&#13;&#10;soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s being soon&#13;&#10;married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its&#13;&#10;exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she&#13;&#10;had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter&#13;&#10;would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her&#13;&#10;felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried. “This is delightful indeed! She will&#13;&#10;be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen!&#13;&#10;My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage&#13;&#10;everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the&#13;&#10;clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about&#13;&#10;them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him&#13;&#10;how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,&#13;&#10;Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear&#13;&#10;Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of&#13;&#10;these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.&#13;&#10;Gardiner’s behaviour laid them all under.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a great&#13;&#10;measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to&#13;&#10;assist Mr. Wickham with money.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but&#13;&#10;her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children&#13;&#10;must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have&#13;&#10;ever had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy!&#13;&#10;In a short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well&#13;&#10;it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in&#13;&#10;such a flutter, that I am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate, and&#13;&#10;you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money&#13;&#10;afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and&#13;&#10;cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had&#13;&#10;not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her&#13;&#10;father was at leisure to be consulted. One day’s delay, she observed,&#13;&#10;would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite&#13;&#10;so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and tell the&#13;&#10;good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call&#13;&#10;on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage.&#13;&#10;An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do&#13;&#10;anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you&#13;&#10;heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall&#13;&#10;all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her&#13;&#10;congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took&#13;&#10;refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Poor Lydia’s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was&#13;&#10;no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in&#13;&#10;looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could&#13;&#10;be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had&#13;&#10;feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had&#13;&#10;gained.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 50&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that,&#13;&#10;instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for&#13;&#10;the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived&#13;&#10;him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that&#13;&#10;respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever&#13;&#10;of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of&#13;&#10;prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be&#13;&#10;her husband might then have rested in its proper place.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone&#13;&#10;should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he&#13;&#10;was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,&#13;&#10;and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly&#13;&#10;useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join&#13;&#10;in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow&#13;&#10;and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters&#13;&#10;successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.&#13;&#10;Bennet, for many years after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that he&#13;&#10;would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then&#13;&#10;too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her&#13;&#10;husband’s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their&#13;&#10;income.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and&#13;&#10;the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the&#13;&#10;latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with&#13;&#10;regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet&#13;&#10;could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In&#13;&#10;terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother,&#13;&#10;though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect&#13;&#10;approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the&#13;&#10;engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed&#13;&#10;that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would&#13;&#10;be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present&#13;&#10;arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the&#13;&#10;hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket&#13;&#10;allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her&#13;&#10;through her mother’s hands, Lydia’s expenses had been very little within&#13;&#10;that sum.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was&#13;&#10;another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as&#13;&#10;little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports&#13;&#10;of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he&#13;&#10;naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon&#13;&#10;dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick&#13;&#10;in its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he&#13;&#10;was indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any&#13;&#10;message to her.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate&#13;&#10;speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent&#13;&#10;philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage&#13;&#10;of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the&#13;&#10;happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant&#13;&#10;farmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the&#13;&#10;good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from&#13;&#10;all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit&#13;&#10;in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery&#13;&#10;was considered certain.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this&#13;&#10;happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in&#13;&#10;spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her&#13;&#10;triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object&#13;&#10;of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of&#13;&#10;accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those&#13;&#10;attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and&#13;&#10;servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a&#13;&#10;proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering&#13;&#10;what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and&#13;&#10;importance.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings could quit it--or the&#13;&#10;great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is&#13;&#10;too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for&#13;&#10;Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the&#13;&#10;servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: “Mrs.&#13;&#10;Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and&#13;&#10;daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this&#13;&#10;neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the&#13;&#10;impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It&#13;&#10;soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,&#13;&#10;that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his&#13;&#10;daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of&#13;&#10;affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend&#13;&#10;it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable&#13;&#10;resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her&#13;&#10;marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe&#13;&#10;possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new&#13;&#10;clothes must reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of&#13;&#10;shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they&#13;&#10;took place.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of&#13;&#10;the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for&#13;&#10;her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the&#13;&#10;proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its&#13;&#10;unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the&#13;&#10;spot.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were&#13;&#10;few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;&#13;&#10;but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister’s&#13;&#10;frailty would have mortified her so much--not, however, from any fear&#13;&#10;of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate,&#13;&#10;there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia’s marriage been&#13;&#10;concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that&#13;&#10;Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other&#13;&#10;objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the&#13;&#10;nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The&#13;&#10;wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his&#13;&#10;feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a&#13;&#10;blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she&#13;&#10;hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no&#13;&#10;longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there&#13;&#10;seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that&#13;&#10;she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they&#13;&#10;should meet.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the&#13;&#10;proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now&#13;&#10;have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she&#13;&#10;doubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal,&#13;&#10;there must be a triumph.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in&#13;&#10;disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and&#13;&#10;temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It&#13;&#10;was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease&#13;&#10;and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;&#13;&#10;and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she&#13;&#10;must have received benefit of greater importance.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what&#13;&#10;connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and&#13;&#10;precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their&#13;&#10;family.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,&#13;&#10;she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could&#13;&#10;belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions&#13;&#10;were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;                          * * * * *&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet’s&#13;&#10;acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to&#13;&#10;promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties&#13;&#10;that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal&#13;&#10;purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved&#13;&#10;on quitting the militia.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon as&#13;&#10;his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in&#13;&#10;considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on&#13;&#10;his account and my niece’s. It is Mr. Wickham’s intention to go into&#13;&#10;the regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who&#13;&#10;are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an&#13;&#10;ensigncy in General ----‘s regiment, now quartered in the North. It&#13;&#10;is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He&#13;&#10;promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each&#13;&#10;have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have&#13;&#10;written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,&#13;&#10;and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham&#13;&#10;in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I&#13;&#10;have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying&#13;&#10;similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin&#13;&#10;a list according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I&#13;&#10;hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions,&#13;&#10;and all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,&#13;&#10;unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.&#13;&#10;Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she&#13;&#10;leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to&#13;&#10;you and her mother.--Yours, etc.,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“E. GARDINER.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham’s removal&#13;&#10;from the ----shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet&#13;&#10;was not so well pleased with it. Lydia’s being settled in the North,&#13;&#10;just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company,&#13;&#10;for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in&#13;&#10;Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a&#13;&#10;pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted&#13;&#10;with everybody, and had so many favourites.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking&#13;&#10;to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she&#13;&#10;likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----‘s&#13;&#10;regiment.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;His daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being&#13;&#10;admitted into her family again before she set off for the North,&#13;&#10;received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth,&#13;&#10;who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings and&#13;&#10;consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,&#13;&#10;urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her&#13;&#10;and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was&#13;&#10;prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their&#13;&#10;mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show&#13;&#10;her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the&#13;&#10;North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent&#13;&#10;his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as&#13;&#10;the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was&#13;&#10;surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and&#13;&#10;had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would&#13;&#10;have been the last object of her wishes.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 51&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Their sister’s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her&#13;&#10;probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to&#13;&#10;meet them at ----, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their&#13;&#10;arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially,&#13;&#10;who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she&#13;&#10;been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister&#13;&#10;must endure.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive&#13;&#10;them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to&#13;&#10;the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,&#13;&#10;anxious, uneasy.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and&#13;&#10;she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and&#13;&#10;welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile,&#13;&#10;to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an&#13;&#10;alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite&#13;&#10;so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely&#13;&#10;opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was&#13;&#10;enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet&#13;&#10;was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy,&#13;&#10;and fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their&#13;&#10;congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly&#13;&#10;round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and&#13;&#10;observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been&#13;&#10;there.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners&#13;&#10;were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been&#13;&#10;exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he&#13;&#10;claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had&#13;&#10;not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,&#13;&#10;resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence&#13;&#10;of an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the&#13;&#10;two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither&#13;&#10;of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,&#13;&#10;with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her&#13;&#10;replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the&#13;&#10;world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led&#13;&#10;voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for&#13;&#10;the world.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went away;&#13;&#10;it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things&#13;&#10;enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure&#13;&#10;I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I&#13;&#10;thought it would be very good fun if I was.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked&#13;&#10;expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of&#13;&#10;which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, “Oh! mamma, do the&#13;&#10;people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not;&#13;&#10;and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he&#13;&#10;should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took&#13;&#10;off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that&#13;&#10;he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room;&#13;&#10;and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to&#13;&#10;the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with&#13;&#10;anxious parade, walk up to her mother’s right hand, and hear her say&#13;&#10;to her eldest sister, “Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go&#13;&#10;lower, because I am a married woman.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment&#13;&#10;from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good&#13;&#10;spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and&#13;&#10;all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham”&#13;&#10; by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her&#13;&#10;ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast&#13;&#10;room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I&#13;&#10;am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half&#13;&#10;my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get&#13;&#10;husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don’t&#13;&#10;at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all&#13;&#10;things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We&#13;&#10;shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some&#13;&#10;balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters&#13;&#10;behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the&#13;&#10;winter is over.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do not&#13;&#10;particularly like your way of getting husbands.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham&#13;&#10;had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join&#13;&#10;his regiment at the end of a fortnight.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and&#13;&#10;she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and&#13;&#10;having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to&#13;&#10;all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did&#13;&#10;think, than such as did not.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Wickham’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected&#13;&#10;to find it; not equal to Lydia’s for him. She had scarcely needed her&#13;&#10;present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that&#13;&#10;their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather&#13;&#10;than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring&#13;&#10;for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain&#13;&#10;that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and&#13;&#10;if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity&#13;&#10;of having a companion.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every&#13;&#10;occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every&#13;&#10;thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on&#13;&#10;the first of September, than any body else in the country.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two&#13;&#10;elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You&#13;&#10;were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you&#13;&#10;curious to hear how it was managed?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little said&#13;&#10;on the subject.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were&#13;&#10;married, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s lodgings were in&#13;&#10;that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven&#13;&#10;o’clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others&#13;&#10;were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in&#13;&#10;such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to&#13;&#10;put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was&#13;&#10;my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as&#13;&#10;if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in&#13;&#10;ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed&#13;&#10;to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never&#13;&#10;be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt&#13;&#10;were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you’ll believe&#13;&#10;me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a&#13;&#10;fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was&#13;&#10;rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so&#13;&#10;just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon&#13;&#10;business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once&#13;&#10;they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I&#13;&#10;did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we&#13;&#10;were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he&#13;&#10;came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all set out. However,&#13;&#10;I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the&#13;&#10;wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious&#13;&#10;me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised&#13;&#10;them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“If it was to be secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the&#13;&#10;subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we will&#13;&#10;ask you no questions.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Thank you,” said Lydia, “for if you did, I should certainly tell you&#13;&#10;all, and then Wickham would be angry.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her&#13;&#10;power, by running away.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least&#13;&#10;it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at&#13;&#10;her sister’s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,&#13;&#10;where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.&#13;&#10;Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her&#13;&#10;brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as&#13;&#10;placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She&#13;&#10;could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,&#13;&#10;wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what&#13;&#10;Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been&#13;&#10;intended.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be&#13;&#10;to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively&#13;&#10;speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such&#13;&#10;a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,&#13;&#10;for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems&#13;&#10;to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with&#13;&#10;ignorance.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Not that I _shall_, though,” she added to herself, as she finished&#13;&#10;the letter; “and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable&#13;&#10;manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it&#13;&#10;out.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Jane’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to&#13;&#10;Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad&#13;&#10;of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any&#13;&#10;satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 52&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as&#13;&#10;soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it&#13;&#10;than, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to&#13;&#10;be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to&#13;&#10;be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not&#13;&#10;contain a denial.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“MY DEAR NIECE,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning&#13;&#10;to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise&#13;&#10;what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your&#13;&#10;application; I did not expect it from _you_. Don’t think me angry,&#13;&#10;however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such&#13;&#10;inquiries to be necessary on _your_ side. If you do not choose to&#13;&#10;understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised&#13;&#10;as I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned&#13;&#10;would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really&#13;&#10;innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most&#13;&#10;unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several&#13;&#10;hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so&#13;&#10;dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr.&#13;&#10;Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were,&#13;&#10;and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly,&#13;&#10;Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day&#13;&#10;after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for&#13;&#10;them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to&#13;&#10;himself that Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as to&#13;&#10;make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide&#13;&#10;in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and&#13;&#10;confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private&#13;&#10;actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He&#13;&#10;called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy&#13;&#10;an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he _had another_&#13;&#10;motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days&#13;&#10;in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to&#13;&#10;direct his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness&#13;&#10;of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago&#13;&#10;governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause&#13;&#10;of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large&#13;&#10;house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting&#13;&#10;lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with&#13;&#10;Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to&#13;&#10;town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he&#13;&#10;wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and&#13;&#10;corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.&#13;&#10;Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had&#13;&#10;she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up&#13;&#10;their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the&#13;&#10;wished-for direction. They were in ---- street. He saw Wickham, and&#13;&#10;afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he&#13;&#10;acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful&#13;&#10;situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed&#13;&#10;on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But&#13;&#10;he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared&#13;&#10;for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear&#13;&#10;of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or&#13;&#10;other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings,&#13;&#10;it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which,&#13;&#10;in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never&#13;&#10;been _his_ design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment,&#13;&#10;on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and&#13;&#10;scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia’s flight on her&#13;&#10;own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as&#13;&#10;to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He&#13;&#10;must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have&#13;&#10;nothing to live on.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though&#13;&#10;Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able&#13;&#10;to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by&#13;&#10;marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still&#13;&#10;cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in&#13;&#10;some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely&#13;&#10;to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of&#13;&#10;course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be&#13;&#10;reasonable.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy’s next step was to&#13;&#10;make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch&#13;&#10;street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be&#13;&#10;seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was&#13;&#10;still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge&#13;&#10;your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your&#13;&#10;uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the&#13;&#10;departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next&#13;&#10;day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home,&#13;&#10;and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It was not all&#13;&#10;settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to&#13;&#10;Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that&#13;&#10;obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been&#13;&#10;accused of many faults at different times, but _this_ is the true one.&#13;&#10;Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and&#13;&#10;I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your&#13;&#10;uncle would most readily have settled the whole.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either&#13;&#10;the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle&#13;&#10;was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his&#13;&#10;niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,&#13;&#10;which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter&#13;&#10;this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation&#13;&#10;that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where&#13;&#10;it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane&#13;&#10;at most.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young&#13;&#10;people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably&#13;&#10;more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own&#13;&#10;settled upon _her_, and his commission purchased. The reason why all&#13;&#10;this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It&#13;&#10;was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that&#13;&#10;Wickham’s character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he&#13;&#10;had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth&#13;&#10;in _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody’s_ reserve,&#13;&#10;can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking,&#13;&#10;my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would&#13;&#10;never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another&#13;&#10;interest_ in the affair.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who&#13;&#10;were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in&#13;&#10;London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were&#13;&#10;then to receive the last finish.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which&#13;&#10;you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not&#13;&#10;afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant&#13;&#10;admission to the house. _He_ was exactly what he had been, when I&#13;&#10;knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was&#13;&#10;satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not&#13;&#10;perceived, by Jane’s letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming&#13;&#10;home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell&#13;&#10;you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most&#13;&#10;serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had&#13;&#10;done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she&#13;&#10;heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was&#13;&#10;sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and&#13;&#10;Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,&#13;&#10;attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave&#13;&#10;town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my&#13;&#10;dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold&#13;&#10;enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,&#13;&#10;in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His&#13;&#10;understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little&#13;&#10;more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach&#13;&#10;him. I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name. But&#13;&#10;slyness seems the fashion.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not&#13;&#10;punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy&#13;&#10;till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little&#13;&#10;pair of ponies, would be the very thing.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half&#13;&#10;hour.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yours, very sincerely,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“M. GARDINER.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,&#13;&#10;in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the&#13;&#10;greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had&#13;&#10;produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister’s&#13;&#10;match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too&#13;&#10;great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the&#13;&#10;pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!&#13;&#10;He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all&#13;&#10;the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which&#13;&#10;supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and&#13;&#10;despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason&#13;&#10;with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to&#13;&#10;avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had&#13;&#10;done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her&#13;&#10;heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly&#13;&#10;checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity&#13;&#10;was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her--for&#13;&#10;a woman who had already refused him--as able to overcome a sentiment so&#13;&#10;natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law&#13;&#10;of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had,&#13;&#10;to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had&#13;&#10;given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary&#13;&#10;stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been&#13;&#10;wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and&#13;&#10;though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she&#13;&#10;could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist&#13;&#10;his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially&#13;&#10;concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were&#13;&#10;under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They&#13;&#10;owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh!&#13;&#10;how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever&#13;&#10;encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For&#13;&#10;herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause&#13;&#10;of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.&#13;&#10;She read over her aunt’s commendation of him again and again. It&#13;&#10;was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some&#13;&#10;pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she&#13;&#10;and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted&#13;&#10;between Mr. Darcy and herself.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one’s&#13;&#10;approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was&#13;&#10;overtaken by Wickham.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said he,&#13;&#10;as he joined her.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not follow&#13;&#10;that the interruption must be unwelcome.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and&#13;&#10;now we are better.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“True. Are the others coming out?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to&#13;&#10;Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that&#13;&#10;you have actually seen Pemberley.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She replied in the affirmative.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much&#13;&#10;for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the&#13;&#10;old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of&#13;&#10;me. But of course she did not mention my name to you.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, she did.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And what did she say?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned&#13;&#10;out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely&#13;&#10;misrepresented.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had&#13;&#10;silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other&#13;&#10;several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said&#13;&#10;Elizabeth. “It must be something particular, to take him there at this&#13;&#10;time of year.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I&#13;&#10;understood from the Gardiners that you had.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And do you like her?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Very much.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year&#13;&#10;or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad&#13;&#10;you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Did you go by the village of Kympton?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I do not recollect that we did.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A&#13;&#10;most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited&#13;&#10;me in every respect.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“How should you have liked making sermons?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty,&#13;&#10;and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to&#13;&#10;repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The&#13;&#10;quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas&#13;&#10;of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the&#13;&#10;circumstance, when you were in Kent?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I have heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was&#13;&#10;left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the&#13;&#10;first, you may remember.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not&#13;&#10;so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually&#13;&#10;declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business&#13;&#10;had been compromised accordingly.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember&#13;&#10;what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast&#13;&#10;to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister’s sake, to provoke him,&#13;&#10;she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let&#13;&#10;us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one&#13;&#10;mind.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though&#13;&#10;he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 53&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he&#13;&#10;never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,&#13;&#10;by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she&#13;&#10;had said enough to keep him quiet.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The day of his and Lydia’s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was&#13;&#10;forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means&#13;&#10;entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to&#13;&#10;continue at least a twelvemonth.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh, lord! I don’t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Write to me very often, my dear.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for&#13;&#10;writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to&#13;&#10;do.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife’s. He&#13;&#10;smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of&#13;&#10;the house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to&#13;&#10;us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas&#13;&#10;himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with&#13;&#10;one’s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,” said&#13;&#10;Elizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied that your other four are&#13;&#10;single.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married,&#13;&#10;but only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so far off. If&#13;&#10;that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly&#13;&#10;relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an&#13;&#10;article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper&#13;&#10;at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her&#13;&#10;master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several&#13;&#10;weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and&#13;&#10;smiled and shook her head by turns.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs.&#13;&#10;Phillips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the better. Not&#13;&#10;that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am&#13;&#10;sure _I_ never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome&#13;&#10;to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen?&#13;&#10;But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to&#13;&#10;mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nicholls was in&#13;&#10;Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose&#13;&#10;to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He&#13;&#10;comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was&#13;&#10;going to the butcher’s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on&#13;&#10;Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing&#13;&#10;colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to&#13;&#10;Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present&#13;&#10;report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don’t imagine it was from&#13;&#10;any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that&#13;&#10;I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect&#13;&#10;me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes&#13;&#10;alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of&#13;&#10;_myself_, but I dread other people’s remarks.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in&#13;&#10;Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no&#13;&#10;other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial&#13;&#10;to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming&#13;&#10;there _with_ his friend’s permission, or being bold enough to come&#13;&#10;without it.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot&#13;&#10;come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this&#13;&#10;speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her&#13;&#10;feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily&#13;&#10;perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,&#13;&#10;more unequal, than she had often seen them.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,&#13;&#10;about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you&#13;&#10;will wait on him of course.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I&#13;&#10;went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in&#13;&#10;nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool’s errand again.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention&#13;&#10;would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to&#13;&#10;Netherfield.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“‘Tis an etiquette I despise,” said he. “If he wants our society,&#13;&#10;let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours&#13;&#10;in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back&#13;&#10;again.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait&#13;&#10;on him. But, however, that shan’t prevent my asking him to dine here, I&#13;&#10;am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will&#13;&#10;make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for&#13;&#10;him.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her&#13;&#10;husband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her&#13;&#10;neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before&#13;&#10;_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It&#13;&#10;would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can&#13;&#10;hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;&#13;&#10;but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she&#13;&#10;says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it&#13;&#10;is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction&#13;&#10;of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have&#13;&#10;always so much.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,&#13;&#10;contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety&#13;&#10;and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted&#13;&#10;the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;&#13;&#10;hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his&#13;&#10;arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,&#13;&#10;enter the paddock and ride towards the house.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely&#13;&#10;kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went&#13;&#10;to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down&#13;&#10;again by her sister.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not&#13;&#10;know.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with&#13;&#10;him before. Mr. what’s-his-name. That tall, proud man.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of&#13;&#10;Mr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must&#13;&#10;say that I hate the very sight of him.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little&#13;&#10;of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness&#13;&#10;which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time&#13;&#10;after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable&#13;&#10;enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their&#13;&#10;mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be&#13;&#10;civil to him only as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without being heard by either&#13;&#10;of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be&#13;&#10;suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.&#13;&#10;Gardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.&#13;&#10;To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,&#13;&#10;and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive&#13;&#10;information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted&#13;&#10;for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an&#13;&#10;interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as&#13;&#10;what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his&#13;&#10;coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,&#13;&#10;was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered&#13;&#10;behaviour in Derbyshire.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a&#13;&#10;minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to&#13;&#10;her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and&#13;&#10;wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early&#13;&#10;enough for expectation.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to&#13;&#10;lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of&#13;&#10;her sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little&#13;&#10;paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the&#13;&#10;gentlemen’s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with&#13;&#10;tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any&#13;&#10;symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down&#13;&#10;again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She&#13;&#10;had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and,&#13;&#10;she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as&#13;&#10;she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother’s&#13;&#10;presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but&#13;&#10;not an improbable, conjecture.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period&#13;&#10;saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.&#13;&#10;Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,&#13;&#10;especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of&#13;&#10;her curtsey and address to his friend.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter&#13;&#10;the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy,&#13;&#10;was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill&#13;&#10;applied.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question&#13;&#10;which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He&#13;&#10;was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but&#13;&#10;it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends,&#13;&#10;when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without&#13;&#10;bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist&#13;&#10;the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often&#13;&#10;found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but&#13;&#10;the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when&#13;&#10;they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry&#13;&#10;with herself for being so.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Could I expect it to be otherwise!” said she. “Yet why did he come?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to&#13;&#10;him she had hardly courage to speak.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He readily agreed to it.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say&#13;&#10;you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope&#13;&#10;it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,&#13;&#10;since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my&#13;&#10;own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have&#13;&#10;seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know;&#13;&#10;though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ‘Lately,&#13;&#10;George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,’ without there being a&#13;&#10;syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.&#13;&#10;It was my brother Gardiner’s drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to&#13;&#10;make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth&#13;&#10;dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could&#13;&#10;not tell.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,”&#13;&#10; continued her mother, “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very&#13;&#10;hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to&#13;&#10;Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay&#13;&#10;I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have&#13;&#10;heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the&#13;&#10;regulars. Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so&#13;&#10;many as he deserves.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such&#13;&#10;misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her,&#13;&#10;however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually&#13;&#10;done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in&#13;&#10;the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her mother,&#13;&#10;“I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr.&#13;&#10;Bennet’s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and&#13;&#10;will save all the best of the covies for you.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth’s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious&#13;&#10;attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had&#13;&#10;flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be&#13;&#10;hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt&#13;&#10;that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for&#13;&#10;moments of such painful confusion.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to&#13;&#10;be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure&#13;&#10;that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either&#13;&#10;one or the other again!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no&#13;&#10;compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing&#13;&#10;how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her&#13;&#10;former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;&#13;&#10;but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He&#13;&#10;found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and&#13;&#10;as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no&#13;&#10;difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded&#13;&#10;that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged,&#13;&#10;that she did not always know when she was silent.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her&#13;&#10;intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at&#13;&#10;Longbourn in a few days time.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added, “for when&#13;&#10;you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with&#13;&#10;us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure&#13;&#10;you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep&#13;&#10;your engagement.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of&#13;&#10;his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine&#13;&#10;there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did&#13;&#10;not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man&#13;&#10;on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride&#13;&#10;of one who had ten thousand a year.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 54&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;&#13;&#10;or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that&#13;&#10;must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed her.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she,&#13;&#10;“did he come at all?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when&#13;&#10;he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If&#13;&#10;he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will&#13;&#10;think no more about him.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach&#13;&#10;of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her&#13;&#10;better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly&#13;&#10;easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by&#13;&#10;his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly&#13;&#10;seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent&#13;&#10;acquaintance.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, very indifferent indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly. “Oh, Jane,&#13;&#10;take care.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with&#13;&#10;you as ever.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;                          * * * * *&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in&#13;&#10;the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good&#13;&#10;humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour’s visit, had&#13;&#10;revived.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two&#13;&#10;who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality&#13;&#10;as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the&#13;&#10;dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take&#13;&#10;the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by&#13;&#10;her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore&#13;&#10;to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to&#13;&#10;hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was&#13;&#10;decided. He placed himself by her.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.&#13;&#10;He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that&#13;&#10;Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes&#13;&#10;likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing&#13;&#10;alarm.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an&#13;&#10;admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane’s happiness, and his&#13;&#10;own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the&#13;&#10;consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It&#13;&#10;gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in&#13;&#10;no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table&#13;&#10;could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little&#13;&#10;such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to&#13;&#10;advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but&#13;&#10;she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and&#13;&#10;cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother’s ungraciousness,&#13;&#10;made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind;&#13;&#10;and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell&#13;&#10;him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the&#13;&#10;family.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of&#13;&#10;bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away&#13;&#10;without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than&#13;&#10;the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious&#13;&#10;and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the&#13;&#10;gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her&#13;&#10;uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all&#13;&#10;her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“If he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “I shall give him up for&#13;&#10;ever.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have&#13;&#10;answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,&#13;&#10;where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,&#13;&#10;in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her&#13;&#10;which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen’s approaching, one of&#13;&#10;the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“The men shan’t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;&#13;&#10;do we?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with&#13;&#10;her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough&#13;&#10;to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for&#13;&#10;being so silly!&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to&#13;&#10;expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not&#13;&#10;protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?&#13;&#10;There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup&#13;&#10;himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Is your sister at Pemberley still?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough,&#13;&#10;these three weeks.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse&#13;&#10;with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for&#13;&#10;some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady’s whispering&#13;&#10;to Elizabeth again, he walked away.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies&#13;&#10;all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him,&#13;&#10;when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her&#13;&#10;mother’s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated&#13;&#10;with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.&#13;&#10;They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had&#13;&#10;nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side&#13;&#10;of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to&#13;&#10;supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the&#13;&#10;others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Well girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “What&#13;&#10;say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,&#13;&#10;I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The&#13;&#10;venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said they never saw so&#13;&#10;fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the&#13;&#10;Lucases’ last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges&#13;&#10;were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French&#13;&#10;cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater&#13;&#10;beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And&#13;&#10;what do you think she said besides? ‘Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her&#13;&#10;at Netherfield at last.’ She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good&#13;&#10;a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,&#13;&#10;and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of&#13;&#10;Bingley’s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at&#13;&#10;last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy&#13;&#10;humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at&#13;&#10;not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It has been a very agreeable day,” said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. “The&#13;&#10;party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we&#13;&#10;may often meet again.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth smiled.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me.&#13;&#10;I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an&#13;&#10;agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am&#13;&#10;perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had&#13;&#10;any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed&#13;&#10;with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally&#13;&#10;pleasing, than any other man.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me smile, and&#13;&#10;are provoking me to it every moment.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“How hard it is in some cases to be believed!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And how impossible in others!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I&#13;&#10;acknowledge?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to&#13;&#10;instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive&#13;&#10;me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 55&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His&#13;&#10;friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in&#13;&#10;ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably&#13;&#10;good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many&#13;&#10;expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Next time you call,” said she, “I hope we shall be more lucky.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would&#13;&#10;give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Can you come to-morrow?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was&#13;&#10;accepted with alacrity.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them&#13;&#10;dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter’s room, in her dressing&#13;&#10;gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is&#13;&#10;come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss&#13;&#10;Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss&#13;&#10;Lizzy’s hair.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say Kitty is&#13;&#10;forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick!&#13;&#10;Where is your sash, my dear?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down&#13;&#10;without one of her sisters.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the&#13;&#10;evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his&#13;&#10;custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of&#13;&#10;the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at&#13;&#10;Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any&#13;&#10;impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last&#13;&#10;Kitty did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter mamma? What do&#13;&#10;you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.” She then sat still&#13;&#10;five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she&#13;&#10;suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, “Come here, my love, I want to&#13;&#10;speak to you,” took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look&#13;&#10;at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her&#13;&#10;entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs.&#13;&#10;Bennet half-opened the door and called out:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth was forced to go.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“We may as well leave them by themselves you know;” said her mother, as&#13;&#10;soon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in&#13;&#10;my dressing-room.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained&#13;&#10;quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned&#13;&#10;into the drawing-room.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every&#13;&#10;thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His&#13;&#10;ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their&#13;&#10;evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the&#13;&#10;mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command&#13;&#10;of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went&#13;&#10;away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.&#13;&#10;Bennet’s means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed&#13;&#10;between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in&#13;&#10;the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy&#13;&#10;returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably&#13;&#10;persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman’s&#13;&#10;concurrence.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent&#13;&#10;the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more&#13;&#10;agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption&#13;&#10;or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into&#13;&#10;silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the&#13;&#10;other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;&#13;&#10;and in the evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was again at work to get&#13;&#10;every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter&#13;&#10;to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;&#13;&#10;for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be&#13;&#10;wanted to counteract her mother’s schemes.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she&#13;&#10;saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother&#13;&#10;had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her&#13;&#10;sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in&#13;&#10;earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of&#13;&#10;both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would&#13;&#10;have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she&#13;&#10;thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and&#13;&#10;Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as&#13;&#10;well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few&#13;&#10;words to her sister, ran out of the room.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give&#13;&#10;pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest&#13;&#10;emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“‘Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh!&#13;&#10;why is not everybody as happy?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth,&#13;&#10;a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of&#13;&#10;kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not&#13;&#10;allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be&#13;&#10;said for the present.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I must go instantly to my mother;” she cried. “I would not on any&#13;&#10;account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it&#13;&#10;from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to&#13;&#10;know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear&#13;&#10;family! how shall I bear so much happiness!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the&#13;&#10;card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease&#13;&#10;with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many&#13;&#10;previous months of suspense and vexation.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious&#13;&#10;circumspection! of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance! the&#13;&#10;happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her&#13;&#10;father had been short and to the purpose.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes&#13;&#10;and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed&#13;&#10;her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with&#13;&#10;great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen&#13;&#10;to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane’s perfections;&#13;&#10;and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his&#13;&#10;expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for&#13;&#10;basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of&#13;&#10;Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and&#13;&#10;himself.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of&#13;&#10;Miss Bennet’s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as&#13;&#10;made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped&#13;&#10;her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or&#13;&#10;speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,&#13;&#10;though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when&#13;&#10;Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed&#13;&#10;how really happy he was.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their&#13;&#10;visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he&#13;&#10;turned to his daughter, and said:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his&#13;&#10;goodness.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You are a good girl;” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in&#13;&#10;thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your&#13;&#10;doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are&#13;&#10;each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so&#13;&#10;easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will&#13;&#10;always exceed your income.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be&#13;&#10;unpardonable in me.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you&#13;&#10;talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely&#13;&#10;more.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so&#13;&#10;happy! I am sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it&#13;&#10;would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not&#13;&#10;be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when&#13;&#10;he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was&#13;&#10;that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that&#13;&#10;ever was seen!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her&#13;&#10;favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger&#13;&#10;sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness&#13;&#10;which she might in future be able to dispense.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty&#13;&#10;begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;&#13;&#10;coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after&#13;&#10;supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough&#13;&#10;detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself&#13;&#10;obliged to accept.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for&#13;&#10;while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else;&#13;&#10;but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours&#13;&#10;of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he&#13;&#10;always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of&#13;&#10;her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of&#13;&#10;relief.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he&#13;&#10;was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed&#13;&#10;it possible.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But how did he account for&#13;&#10;it?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It must have been his sister’s doing. They were certainly no friends to&#13;&#10;his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have&#13;&#10;chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,&#13;&#10;as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will&#13;&#10;learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we&#13;&#10;can never be what we once were to each other.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I ever&#13;&#10;heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again&#13;&#10;the dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,&#13;&#10;he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being&#13;&#10;indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his&#13;&#10;modesty.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and&#13;&#10;the little value he put on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased&#13;&#10;to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for,&#13;&#10;though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she&#13;&#10;knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried&#13;&#10;Jane. “Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed&#13;&#10;above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but&#13;&#10;such another man for you!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as&#13;&#10;you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your&#13;&#10;happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very&#13;&#10;good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a&#13;&#10;secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips,&#13;&#10;and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her&#13;&#10;neighbours in Meryton.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the&#13;&#10;world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,&#13;&#10;they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 56&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;One morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane had been&#13;&#10;formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the&#13;&#10;dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the&#13;&#10;sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up&#13;&#10;the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the&#13;&#10;equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses&#13;&#10;were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who&#13;&#10;preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that&#13;&#10;somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid&#13;&#10;the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the&#13;&#10;shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three&#13;&#10;continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown&#13;&#10;open and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their&#13;&#10;astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.&#13;&#10;Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even&#13;&#10;inferior to what Elizabeth felt.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no&#13;&#10;other reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight inclination of the&#13;&#10;head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her&#13;&#10;name to her mother on her ladyship’s entrance, though no request of&#13;&#10;introduction had been made.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such&#13;&#10;high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting&#13;&#10;for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your&#13;&#10;mother.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine.&#13;&#10;“She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,&#13;&#10;and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man&#13;&#10;who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine after a short&#13;&#10;silence.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I&#13;&#10;assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in&#13;&#10;summer; the windows are full west.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then&#13;&#10;added:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and&#13;&#10;Mrs. Collins well.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from&#13;&#10;Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no&#13;&#10;letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some&#13;&#10;refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,&#13;&#10;declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness&#13;&#10;on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you&#13;&#10;will favour me with your company.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her ladyship about the&#13;&#10;different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,&#13;&#10;attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the&#13;&#10;hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and&#13;&#10;drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent&#13;&#10;looking rooms, walked on.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her&#13;&#10;waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk&#13;&#10;that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for&#13;&#10;conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and&#13;&#10;disagreeable.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in&#13;&#10;her face.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following&#13;&#10;manner:--&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my&#13;&#10;journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I&#13;&#10;come.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account&#13;&#10;for the honour of seeing you here.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Miss Bennet,” replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought to&#13;&#10;know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may&#13;&#10;choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been&#13;&#10;celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such&#13;&#10;moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most&#13;&#10;alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your&#13;&#10;sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that&#13;&#10;you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon&#13;&#10;afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I&#13;&#10;_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him&#13;&#10;so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved&#13;&#10;on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to&#13;&#10;you.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring&#13;&#10;with astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of coming&#13;&#10;so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Elizabeth&#13;&#10;coolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report&#13;&#10;is in existence.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been&#13;&#10;industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a&#13;&#10;report is spread abroad?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I never heard that it was.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may&#13;&#10;ask questions which I shall not choose to answer.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has&#13;&#10;he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his&#13;&#10;reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,&#13;&#10;have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You&#13;&#10;may have drawn him in.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such&#13;&#10;language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,&#13;&#10;and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this,&#13;&#10;ever induce me to be explicit.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the&#13;&#10;presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is&#13;&#10;engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will&#13;&#10;make an offer to me.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,&#13;&#10;they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of&#13;&#10;_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned&#13;&#10;the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would&#13;&#10;be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of&#13;&#10;inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to&#13;&#10;the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his&#13;&#10;tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of&#13;&#10;propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest&#13;&#10;hours he was destined for his cousin?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is&#13;&#10;no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not&#13;&#10;be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to&#13;&#10;marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the&#13;&#10;marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither&#13;&#10;by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make&#13;&#10;another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes,&#13;&#10;Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or&#13;&#10;friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will&#13;&#10;be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.&#13;&#10;Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned&#13;&#10;by any of us.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth. “But the wife of Mr.&#13;&#10;Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily&#13;&#10;attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause&#13;&#10;to repine.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude&#13;&#10;for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that&#13;&#10;score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came&#13;&#10;here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will&#13;&#10;I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person’s&#13;&#10;whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“_That_ will make your ladyship’s situation at present more pitiable;&#13;&#10;but it will have no effect on me.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my&#13;&#10;nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal&#13;&#10;side, from the same noble line; and, on the father’s, from respectable,&#13;&#10;honourable, and ancient--though untitled--families. Their fortune on&#13;&#10;both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of&#13;&#10;every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?&#13;&#10;The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections,&#13;&#10;or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you&#13;&#10;were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in&#13;&#10;which you have been brought up.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that&#13;&#10;sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman’s daughter; so far we are&#13;&#10;equal.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“True. You _are_ a gentleman’s daughter. But who was your mother?&#13;&#10;Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their&#13;&#10;condition.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your nephew does&#13;&#10;not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady&#13;&#10;Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a&#13;&#10;moment’s deliberation:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am not.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lady Catherine seemed pleased.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I will make no promise of the kind.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more&#13;&#10;reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that&#13;&#10;I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the&#13;&#10;assurance I require.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into&#13;&#10;anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry&#13;&#10;your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their&#13;&#10;marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would&#13;&#10;my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?&#13;&#10;Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have&#13;&#10;supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the&#13;&#10;application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if&#13;&#10;you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your&#13;&#10;nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell;&#13;&#10;but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,&#13;&#10;therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the&#13;&#10;objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am&#13;&#10;no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s infamous&#13;&#10;elopement. I know it all; that the young man’s marrying her was a&#13;&#10;patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is&#13;&#10;such a girl to be my nephew’s sister? Is her husband, is the son of his&#13;&#10;late father’s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what are&#13;&#10;you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You can now have nothing further to say,” she resentfully answered.&#13;&#10;“You have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to&#13;&#10;the house.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned&#13;&#10;back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!&#13;&#10;Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you&#13;&#10;must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You are then resolved to have him?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,&#13;&#10;which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without&#13;&#10;reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the&#13;&#10;claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in&#13;&#10;the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth, “have any&#13;&#10;possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either&#13;&#10;would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the&#13;&#10;resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former&#13;&#10;_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment’s&#13;&#10;concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in&#13;&#10;the scorn.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well.&#13;&#10;I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your&#13;&#10;ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you&#13;&#10;reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of&#13;&#10;the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, “I take no leave&#13;&#10;of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve&#13;&#10;no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her&#13;&#10;ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She&#13;&#10;heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother&#13;&#10;impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady&#13;&#10;Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“She did not choose it,” said her daughter, “she would go.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously&#13;&#10;civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were&#13;&#10;well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through&#13;&#10;Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had&#13;&#10;nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to&#13;&#10;acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 57&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw&#13;&#10;Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many&#13;&#10;hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it&#13;&#10;appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,&#13;&#10;for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.&#13;&#10;Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report&#13;&#10;of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;&#13;&#10;till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,&#13;&#10;and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the&#13;&#10;expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply&#13;&#10;the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her&#13;&#10;sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours&#13;&#10;at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the&#13;&#10;Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had&#13;&#10;only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked&#13;&#10;forward to as possible at some future time.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she could not help&#13;&#10;feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting&#13;&#10;in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to&#13;&#10;prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate&#13;&#10;an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar&#13;&#10;representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared&#13;&#10;not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his&#13;&#10;aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose&#13;&#10;that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it&#13;&#10;was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,&#13;&#10;whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would&#13;&#10;address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would&#13;&#10;probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak&#13;&#10;and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often&#13;&#10;seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might&#13;&#10;settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity&#13;&#10;unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady&#13;&#10;Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to&#13;&#10;Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his&#13;&#10;friend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to understand&#13;&#10;it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his&#13;&#10;constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might&#13;&#10;have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him&#13;&#10;at all.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;                          * * * * *&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had&#13;&#10;been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same&#13;&#10;kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet’s curiosity; and&#13;&#10;Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her&#13;&#10;father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you; come into my room.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to&#13;&#10;tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner&#13;&#10;connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it&#13;&#10;might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the&#13;&#10;consequent explanations.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He&#13;&#10;then said,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me&#13;&#10;exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its&#13;&#10;contents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink&#13;&#10;of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The colour now rushed into Elizabeth’s cheeks in the instantaneous&#13;&#10;conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;&#13;&#10;and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained&#13;&#10;himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to&#13;&#10;herself; when her father continued:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters&#13;&#10;as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the&#13;&#10;name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with&#13;&#10;congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of&#13;&#10;which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping&#13;&#10;Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says&#13;&#10;on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows: ‘Having thus&#13;&#10;offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on&#13;&#10;this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another;&#13;&#10;of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after&#13;&#10;her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may&#13;&#10;be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in&#13;&#10;this land.’&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? ‘This young&#13;&#10;gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of&#13;&#10;mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive&#13;&#10;patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate&#13;&#10;closure with this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course, you will be&#13;&#10;inclined to take immediate advantage of.’&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“‘My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine&#13;&#10;that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with&#13;&#10;a friendly eye.’&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_&#13;&#10;surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within&#13;&#10;the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie&#13;&#10;more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any&#13;&#10;woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his&#13;&#10;life! It is admirable!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but could only force&#13;&#10;one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so&#13;&#10;little agreeable to her.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Are you not diverted?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! yes. Pray read on.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“‘After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last&#13;&#10;night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she&#13;&#10;felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some&#13;&#10;family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her&#13;&#10;consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty&#13;&#10;to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and&#13;&#10;her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run&#13;&#10;hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ Mr.&#13;&#10;Collins moreover adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia’s sad&#13;&#10;business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their&#13;&#10;living together before the marriage took place should be so generally&#13;&#10;known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain&#13;&#10;from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young&#13;&#10;couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an&#13;&#10;encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should&#13;&#10;very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them,&#13;&#10;as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their&#13;&#10;names to be mentioned in your hearing.’ That is his notion of Christian&#13;&#10;forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte’s&#13;&#10;situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you&#13;&#10;look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be _missish_,&#13;&#10;I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we&#13;&#10;live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our&#13;&#10;turn?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh!” cried Elizabeth, “I am excessively diverted. But it is so&#13;&#10;strange!”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man&#13;&#10;it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_&#13;&#10;pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate&#13;&#10;writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins’s correspondence for any&#13;&#10;consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving&#13;&#10;him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and&#13;&#10;hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine&#13;&#10;about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had&#13;&#10;been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by&#13;&#10;his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her&#13;&#10;feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she&#13;&#10;would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by&#13;&#10;what he said of Mr. Darcy’s indifference, and she could do nothing but&#13;&#10;wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of&#13;&#10;his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 58&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as&#13;&#10;Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy&#13;&#10;with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine’s&#13;&#10;visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time&#13;&#10;to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat&#13;&#10;in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed&#13;&#10;their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the&#13;&#10;habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five&#13;&#10;set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others&#13;&#10;to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy&#13;&#10;were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty&#13;&#10;was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a&#13;&#10;desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon&#13;&#10;Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,&#13;&#10;when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the&#13;&#10;moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was&#13;&#10;high, she immediately said:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving&#13;&#10;relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I&#13;&#10;can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my&#13;&#10;poor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to&#13;&#10;acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest&#13;&#10;of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise&#13;&#10;and emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in a&#13;&#10;mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner&#13;&#10;was so little to be trusted.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You must not blame my aunt. Lydia’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to&#13;&#10;me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could&#13;&#10;not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,&#13;&#10;in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced&#13;&#10;you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the&#13;&#10;sake of discovering them.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“If you _will_ thank me,” he replied, “let it be for yourself alone.&#13;&#10;That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other&#13;&#10;inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your&#13;&#10;_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought&#13;&#10;only of _you_.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,&#13;&#10;her companion added, “You are too generous to trifle with me. If your&#13;&#10;feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_&#13;&#10;affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence&#13;&#10;me on this subject for ever.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of&#13;&#10;his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not&#13;&#10;very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone&#13;&#10;so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make&#13;&#10;her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The&#13;&#10;happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never&#13;&#10;felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as&#13;&#10;warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth&#13;&#10;been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the&#13;&#10;expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him;&#13;&#10;but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of&#13;&#10;feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his&#13;&#10;affection every moment more valuable.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to&#13;&#10;be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She&#13;&#10;soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding&#13;&#10;to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through&#13;&#10;London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the&#13;&#10;substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on&#13;&#10;every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship’s apprehension,&#13;&#10;peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that&#13;&#10;such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise&#13;&#10;from her nephew which she had refused to give. But, unluckily for her&#13;&#10;ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed myself&#13;&#10;to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that,&#13;&#10;had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have&#13;&#10;acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes, you know enough&#13;&#10;of my frankness to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so&#13;&#10;abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all&#13;&#10;your relations.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your&#13;&#10;accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my&#13;&#10;behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was&#13;&#10;unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that&#13;&#10;evening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,&#13;&#10;will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved&#13;&#10;in civility.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I&#13;&#10;then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of&#13;&#10;it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your&#13;&#10;reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: ‘had you behaved in a&#13;&#10;more gentlemanlike manner.’ Those were your words. You know not, you can&#13;&#10;scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time,&#13;&#10;I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an&#13;&#10;impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such&#13;&#10;a way.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper&#13;&#10;feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never&#13;&#10;forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible&#13;&#10;way that would induce you to accept me.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at&#13;&#10;all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Darcy mentioned his letter. “Did it,” said he, “did it soon make you&#13;&#10;think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its&#13;&#10;contents?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her&#13;&#10;former prejudices had been removed.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I knew,” said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was&#13;&#10;necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part&#13;&#10;especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the&#13;&#10;power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might&#13;&#10;justly make you hate me.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the&#13;&#10;preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my&#13;&#10;opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily&#13;&#10;changed as that implies.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“When I wrote that letter,” replied Darcy, “I believed myself perfectly&#13;&#10;calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a&#13;&#10;dreadful bitterness of spirit.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The&#13;&#10;adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings&#13;&#10;of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now&#13;&#10;so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant&#13;&#10;circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some&#13;&#10;of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you&#13;&#10;pleasure.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your&#13;&#10;retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment&#13;&#10;arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of&#13;&#10;innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude&#13;&#10;which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish&#13;&#10;being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I&#13;&#10;was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I&#13;&#10;was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.&#13;&#10;Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt&#13;&#10;by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all&#13;&#10;that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught&#13;&#10;me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family&#13;&#10;circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least&#13;&#10;to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I&#13;&#10;was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been&#13;&#10;but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You&#13;&#10;taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you,&#13;&#10;I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception.&#13;&#10;You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman&#13;&#10;worthy of being pleased.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be&#13;&#10;wishing, expecting my addresses.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure&#13;&#10;you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me&#13;&#10;wrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take&#13;&#10;a proper direction.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at&#13;&#10;Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.&#13;&#10;My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I&#13;&#10;confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My object then,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civility in&#13;&#10;my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to&#13;&#10;obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you&#13;&#10;see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes&#13;&#10;introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an&#13;&#10;hour after I had seen you.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He then told her of Georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and of her&#13;&#10;disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to&#13;&#10;the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of&#13;&#10;following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed&#13;&#10;before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness&#13;&#10;there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must&#13;&#10;comprehend.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to&#13;&#10;each, to be dwelt on farther.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know&#13;&#10;anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that&#13;&#10;it was time to be at home.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!” was a wonder which&#13;&#10;introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted with&#13;&#10;their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of&#13;&#10;it.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I must ask whether you were surprised?” said Elizabeth.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.” And&#13;&#10;though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much&#13;&#10;the case.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“On the evening before my going to London,” said he, “I made a&#13;&#10;confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I&#13;&#10;told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his&#13;&#10;affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had&#13;&#10;the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself&#13;&#10;mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent&#13;&#10;to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was&#13;&#10;unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his&#13;&#10;friend.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you told him&#13;&#10;that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits&#13;&#10;which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to&#13;&#10;him.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had&#13;&#10;prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but&#13;&#10;his reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess&#13;&#10;one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not&#13;&#10;allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months&#13;&#10;last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was&#13;&#10;angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained&#13;&#10;in any doubt of your sister’s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me&#13;&#10;now.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful&#13;&#10;friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked&#13;&#10;herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at,&#13;&#10;and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness&#13;&#10;of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he&#13;&#10;continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they&#13;&#10;parted.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 59&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a question&#13;&#10;which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room,&#13;&#10;and from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to&#13;&#10;say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own&#13;&#10;knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything&#13;&#10;else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The&#13;&#10;acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.&#13;&#10;Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;&#13;&#10;and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy&#13;&#10;than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,&#13;&#10;there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt&#13;&#10;in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no&#13;&#10;one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a&#13;&#10;dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far&#13;&#10;from Miss Bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,&#13;&#10;you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and&#13;&#10;I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am&#13;&#10;in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are&#13;&#10;engaged.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Jane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much&#13;&#10;you dislike him.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I&#13;&#10;did not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as&#13;&#10;these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever&#13;&#10;remember it myself.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more&#13;&#10;seriously assured her of its truth.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,” cried&#13;&#10;Jane. “My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you&#13;&#10;certain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be&#13;&#10;happy with him?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that&#13;&#10;we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased,&#13;&#10;Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more&#13;&#10;delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you&#13;&#10;really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than&#13;&#10;marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought&#13;&#10;to do?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I&#13;&#10;tell you all.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“What do you mean?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am&#13;&#10;afraid you will be angry.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My dearest sister, now _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let&#13;&#10;me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me&#13;&#10;how long you have loved him?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.&#13;&#10;But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds&#13;&#10;at Pemberley.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the&#13;&#10;desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances&#13;&#10;of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing&#13;&#10;further to wish.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself.&#13;&#10;I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you,&#13;&#10;I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley’s friend and your&#13;&#10;husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But&#13;&#10;Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you&#13;&#10;tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know&#13;&#10;of it to another, not to you.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling&#13;&#10;to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made&#13;&#10;her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer&#13;&#10;conceal from her his share in Lydia’s marriage. All was acknowledged,&#13;&#10;and half the night spent in conversation.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;                          * * * * *&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next&#13;&#10;morning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with&#13;&#10;our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always&#13;&#10;coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or&#13;&#10;other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?&#13;&#10;Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley’s&#13;&#10;way.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet&#13;&#10;was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an&#13;&#10;epithet.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and&#13;&#10;shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;&#13;&#10;and he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes&#13;&#10;hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to walk&#13;&#10;to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has&#13;&#10;never seen the view.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I am&#13;&#10;sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?” Kitty owned that&#13;&#10;she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see&#13;&#10;the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went&#13;&#10;up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that&#13;&#10;disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is&#13;&#10;all for Jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking&#13;&#10;to him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to&#13;&#10;inconvenience.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent should be&#13;&#10;asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the&#13;&#10;application for her mother’s. She could not determine how her mother&#13;&#10;would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur&#13;&#10;would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she&#13;&#10;were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it&#13;&#10;was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit&#13;&#10;to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear&#13;&#10;the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her&#13;&#10;disapprobation.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;                          * * * * *&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw&#13;&#10;Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was&#13;&#10;extreme. She did not fear her father’s opposition, but he was going to&#13;&#10;be made unhappy; and that it should be through her means--that _she_,&#13;&#10;his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be&#13;&#10;filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her--was a wretched&#13;&#10;reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,&#13;&#10;looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes&#13;&#10;he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while&#13;&#10;pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, “Go to your father, he&#13;&#10;wants you in the library.” She was gone directly.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.&#13;&#10;“Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be&#13;&#10;accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more&#13;&#10;reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from&#13;&#10;explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;&#13;&#10;but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,&#13;&#10;of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be&#13;&#10;sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.&#13;&#10;But will they make you happy?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief of my&#13;&#10;indifference?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but&#13;&#10;this would be nothing if you really liked him.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes, “I love him.&#13;&#10;Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not&#13;&#10;know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in&#13;&#10;such terms.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the kind&#13;&#10;of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he&#13;&#10;condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on&#13;&#10;having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know&#13;&#10;your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor&#13;&#10;respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked&#13;&#10;up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the&#13;&#10;greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape&#13;&#10;discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing&#13;&#10;_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are&#13;&#10;about.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and&#13;&#10;at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object&#13;&#10;of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of&#13;&#10;him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection&#13;&#10;was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months’&#13;&#10;suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did&#13;&#10;conquer her father’s incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no more to&#13;&#10;say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with&#13;&#10;you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy&#13;&#10;had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing;&#13;&#10;made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him&#13;&#10;his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble&#13;&#10;and economy. Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must and _would_ have&#13;&#10;paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own&#13;&#10;way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about&#13;&#10;his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading&#13;&#10;Mr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her&#13;&#10;at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come&#13;&#10;for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after&#13;&#10;half an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join&#13;&#10;the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for&#13;&#10;gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer&#13;&#10;anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity&#13;&#10;would come in time.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,&#13;&#10;and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;&#13;&#10;for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to&#13;&#10;utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could&#13;&#10;comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit&#13;&#10;what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a&#13;&#10;lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in&#13;&#10;her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would&#13;&#10;have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich&#13;&#10;and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages&#13;&#10;you will have! Jane’s is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so&#13;&#10;pleased--so happy. Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my&#13;&#10;dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I&#13;&#10;hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing&#13;&#10;that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,&#13;&#10;Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and&#13;&#10;Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,&#13;&#10;soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,&#13;&#10;her mother followed her.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else! Ten&#13;&#10;thousand a year, and very likely more! ‘Tis as good as a Lord! And a&#13;&#10;special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But&#13;&#10;my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of,&#13;&#10;that I may have it to-morrow.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the gentleman&#13;&#10;himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain&#13;&#10;possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations’&#13;&#10;consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow&#13;&#10;passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood&#13;&#10;in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to&#13;&#10;him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her&#13;&#10;deference for his opinion.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get&#13;&#10;acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising&#13;&#10;every hour in his esteem.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “Wickham, perhaps,&#13;&#10;is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well&#13;&#10;as Jane’s.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 60&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Elizabeth’s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.&#13;&#10;Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. “How could&#13;&#10;you begin?” said she. “I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when&#13;&#10;you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first&#13;&#10;place?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which&#13;&#10;laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I&#13;&#10;knew that I _had_ begun.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour&#13;&#10;to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke&#13;&#10;to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere;&#13;&#10;did you admire me for my impertinence?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“For the liveliness of your mind, I did.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.&#13;&#10;The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious&#13;&#10;attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,&#13;&#10;and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused, and&#13;&#10;interested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really&#13;&#10;amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you&#13;&#10;took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and&#13;&#10;in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously&#13;&#10;courted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for&#13;&#10;it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly&#13;&#10;reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks&#13;&#10;of _that_ when they fall in love.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was&#13;&#10;ill at Netherfield?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it&#13;&#10;by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are&#13;&#10;to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me&#13;&#10;to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may&#13;&#10;be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling&#13;&#10;to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first&#13;&#10;called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did&#13;&#10;you look as if you did not care about me?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“But I was embarrassed.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And so was I.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“A man who had felt less, might.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that&#13;&#10;I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you&#13;&#10;_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when&#13;&#10;you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of&#13;&#10;thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.&#13;&#10;_Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort&#13;&#10;springs from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the&#13;&#10;subject. This will never do.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady&#13;&#10;Catherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of&#13;&#10;removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to&#13;&#10;your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour&#13;&#10;to wait for any opening of yours. My aunt’s intelligence had given me&#13;&#10;hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,&#13;&#10;for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to&#13;&#10;Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?&#13;&#10;or had you intended any more serious consequence?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I&#13;&#10;might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to&#13;&#10;myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley,&#13;&#10;and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to&#13;&#10;befall her?”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth. But it&#13;&#10;ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be&#13;&#10;done directly.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and&#13;&#10;admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But&#13;&#10;I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy&#13;&#10;had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner’s&#13;&#10;long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would&#13;&#10;be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and&#13;&#10;aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as&#13;&#10;follows:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,&#13;&#10;for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the&#13;&#10;truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.&#13;&#10;But _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose rein to your&#13;&#10;fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the&#13;&#10;subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you&#13;&#10;cannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a&#13;&#10;great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again,&#13;&#10;for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your&#13;&#10;idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I&#13;&#10;am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so&#13;&#10;before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she&#13;&#10;only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that&#13;&#10;he can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.&#13;&#10;Yours, etc.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Darcy’s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still&#13;&#10;different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply&#13;&#10;to his last.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“DEAR SIR,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon&#13;&#10;be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can.&#13;&#10;But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yours sincerely, etc.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Miss Bingley’s congratulations to her brother, on his approaching&#13;&#10;marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even&#13;&#10;to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her&#13;&#10;former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was&#13;&#10;affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing&#13;&#10;her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information,&#13;&#10;was as sincere as her brother’s in sending it. Four sides of paper were&#13;&#10;insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of&#13;&#10;being loved by her sister.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations&#13;&#10;to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the&#13;&#10;Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this&#13;&#10;sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered&#13;&#10;so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew’s letter, that&#13;&#10;Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till&#13;&#10;the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend&#13;&#10;was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their&#13;&#10;meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she&#13;&#10;saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of&#13;&#10;her husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even&#13;&#10;listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away&#13;&#10;the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all&#13;&#10;meeting frequently at St. James’s, with very decent composure. If he did&#13;&#10;shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mrs. Phillips’s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his&#13;&#10;forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood in&#13;&#10;too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley’s good&#13;&#10;humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.&#13;&#10;Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all&#13;&#10;likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield&#13;&#10;him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep&#13;&#10;him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse&#13;&#10;without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising&#13;&#10;from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it&#13;&#10;added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to&#13;&#10;the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing&#13;&#10;to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at&#13;&#10;Pemberley.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Chapter 61&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got&#13;&#10;rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride&#13;&#10;she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may&#13;&#10;be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the&#13;&#10;accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many&#13;&#10;of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,&#13;&#10;amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it&#13;&#10;was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity&#13;&#10;in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and&#13;&#10;invariably silly.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her&#13;&#10;drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in&#13;&#10;going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near&#13;&#10;a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to&#13;&#10;_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his&#13;&#10;sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county&#13;&#10;to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source&#13;&#10;of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with&#13;&#10;her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally&#13;&#10;known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a&#13;&#10;temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia’s example,&#13;&#10;she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less&#13;&#10;ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia’s&#13;&#10;society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham&#13;&#10;frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of&#13;&#10;balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily&#13;&#10;drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet’s being quite&#13;&#10;unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but&#13;&#10;she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no&#13;&#10;longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters’ beauty and her own,&#13;&#10;it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without&#13;&#10;much reluctance.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from&#13;&#10;the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that&#13;&#10;Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude&#13;&#10;and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every&#13;&#10;thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on&#13;&#10;to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received&#13;&#10;from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,&#13;&#10;if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this&#13;&#10;effect:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“MY DEAR LIZZY,&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear&#13;&#10;Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so&#13;&#10;rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.&#13;&#10;I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not&#13;&#10;think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.&#13;&#10;Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however,&#13;&#10;do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;“Yours, etc.”&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in&#13;&#10;her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.&#13;&#10;Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice&#13;&#10;of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she&#13;&#10;frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an&#13;&#10;income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in&#13;&#10;their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to&#13;&#10;their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or&#13;&#10;herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance&#13;&#10;towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the&#13;&#10;restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the&#13;&#10;extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap&#13;&#10;situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for&#13;&#10;her soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and&#13;&#10;in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to&#13;&#10;reputation which her marriage had given her.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for&#13;&#10;Elizabeth’s sake, he assisted him further in his profession. Lydia was&#13;&#10;occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself&#13;&#10;in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently&#13;&#10;staid so long, that even Bingley’s good humour was overcome, and he&#13;&#10;proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy’s marriage; but as she&#13;&#10;thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she&#13;&#10;dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as&#13;&#10;attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility&#13;&#10;to Elizabeth.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Pemberley was now Georgiana’s home; and the attachment of the sisters&#13;&#10;was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each&#13;&#10;other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion&#13;&#10;in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with&#13;&#10;an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of&#13;&#10;talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect&#13;&#10;which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open&#13;&#10;pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen&#13;&#10;in her way. By Elizabeth’s instructions, she began to comprehend that&#13;&#10;a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not&#13;&#10;always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;&#13;&#10;and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in&#13;&#10;her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him&#13;&#10;language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time&#13;&#10;all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth’s persuasion,&#13;&#10;he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;&#13;&#10;and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her&#13;&#10;resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity&#13;&#10;to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait&#13;&#10;on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had&#13;&#10;received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the&#13;&#10;visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.&#13;&#10;Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever&#13;&#10;sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing&#13;&#10;her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRIDE AND PREJUDICE ***&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;***** This file should be named 1342-0.txt or 1342-0.zip *****&#13;&#10;This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:&#13;&#10;        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/3/4/1342/&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Produced by Anonymous Volunteers&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions&#13;&#10;will be renamed.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no&#13;&#10;one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation&#13;&#10;(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without&#13;&#10;permission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of&#13;&#10;electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers&#13;&#10;including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists&#13;&#10;because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from&#13;&#10;people in all walks of life.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the&#13;&#10;assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm’s&#13;&#10;goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will&#13;&#10;remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project&#13;&#10;Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure&#13;&#10;and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.&#13;&#10;To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation&#13;&#10;and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4&#13;&#10;and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Section 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg&#13;&#10;Literary Archive Foundation&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide&#13;&#10;spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of&#13;&#10;increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be&#13;&#10;freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest&#13;&#10;array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations&#13;&#10;($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt&#13;&#10;status with the IRS.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating&#13;&#10;charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United&#13;&#10;States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a&#13;&#10;considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up&#13;&#10;with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations&#13;&#10;where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To&#13;&#10;SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any&#13;&#10;particular state visit http://pglaf.org&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we&#13;&#10;have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition&#13;&#10;against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who&#13;&#10;approach us with offers to donate.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make&#13;&#10;any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from&#13;&#10;outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation&#13;&#10;methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other&#13;&#10;ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.&#13;&#10;To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic&#13;&#10;works.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm&#13;&#10;concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared&#13;&#10;with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project&#13;&#10;Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed&#13;&#10;editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.&#13;&#10;unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily&#13;&#10;keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;     http://www.gutenberg.org&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,&#13;&#10;including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary&#13;&#10;Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to&#13;&#10;subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.&#13;&#10;"/><cas:View sofa="1"
